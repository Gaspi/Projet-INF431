scene i london the palace

enter king henry lord john of lancaster the earl of westmoreland sir walter blunt and others


king henry iv

so shaken as we are so wan with care
find we a time for frighted peace to pant
and breathe short-winded accents of new broils
to be commenced in strands afar remote
no more the thirsty entrance of this soil
shall daub her lips with her own children blood
nor more shall trenching war channel her fields
nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
of hostile paces those opposed eyes
which like the meteors of a troubled heaven
all of one nature of one substance bred
did lately meet in the intestine shock
and furious close of civil butchery
shall now in mutual well-beseeming ranks
march all one way and be no more opposed
against acquaintance kindred and allies
the edge of war like an ill-sheathed knife
no more shall cut his master therefore friends
as far as to the sepulchre of christ
whose soldier now under whose blessed cross
we are impressed and engaged to fight
forthwith a power of english shall we levy
whose arms were moulded in their mothers womb
to chase these pagans in those holy fields
over whose acres walk those blessed feet
which fourteen hundred years ago were nail
for our advantage on the bitter cross
but this our purpose now is twelve month old
and bootless tis to tell you we will go
therefore we meet not now then let me hear
of you my gentle cousin westmoreland
what yesternight our council did decree
in forwarding this dear expedience


westmoreland

my liege this haste was hot in question
and many limits of the charge set down
but yesternight when all athwart there came
a post from wales loaden with heavy news
whose worst was that the noble mortimer
leading the men of herefordshire to fight
against the irregular and wild glendower
was by the rude hands of that welshman taken
a thousand of his people butchered
upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse
such beastly shameless transformation
by those welshwomen done as may not be
without much shame retold or spoken of


king henry iv

it seems then that the tidings of this broil
brake off our business for the holy land


westmoreland

this match with other did my gracious lord
for more uneven and unwelcome news
came from the north and thus it did import
on holy-rood day the gallant hotspur there
young harry percy and brave archibald
that ever-valiant and approved scot
at holmedon met
where they did spend a sad and bloody hour
as by discharge of their artillery
and shape of likelihood the news was told
for he that brought them in the very heat
and pride of their contention did take horse
uncertain of the issue any way


king henry iv

here is a dear a true industrious friend
sir walter blunt new lighted from his horse
stain with the variation of each soil
betwixt that holmedon and this seat of ours
and he hath brought us smooth and welcome news
the earl of douglas is discomfited
ten thousand bold scots two and twenty knights
balk in their own blood did sir walter see
on holmedon plains of prisoners hotspur took
mordake the earl of fife and eldest son
to beaten douglas and the earl of athol
of murray angus and menteith
and is not this an honourable spoil
a gallant prize ha cousin is it not


westmoreland

in faith
it is a conquest for a prince to boast of


king henry iv

yea there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
in envy that my lord northumberland
should be the father to so blest a son
a son who is the theme of honour tongue
amongst a grove the very straightest plant
who is sweet fortune minion and her pride
whilst i by looking on the praise of him
see riot and dishonour stain the brow
of my young harry o that it could be proved
that some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
in cradle-clothes our children where they lay
and call mine percy his plantagenet
then would i have his harry and he mine
but let him from my thoughts what think you coz
of this young percy pride the prisoners
which he in this adventure hath surprised
to his own use he keeps and sends me word
i shall have none but mordake earl of fife


westmoreland

this is his uncle teaching this is worcester
malevolent to you in all aspects
which makes him prune himself and bristle up
the crest of youth against your dignity


king henry iv

but i have sent for him to answer this
and for this cause awhile we must neglect
our holy purpose to jerusalem
cousin on wednesday next our council we
will hold at windsor so inform the lords
but come yourself with speed to us again
for more is to be said and to be done
than out of anger can be uttered


westmoreland

i will my liege
exeunt

scene ii london an apartment of the prince

enter the prince of wales and falstaff


falstaff

now hal what time of day is it lad


prince henry

thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack
and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
benches after noon that thou hast forgotten to
demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know
what a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
day unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta i see no
reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
the time of the day


falstaff

indeed you come near me now hal for we that take
purses go by the moon and the seven stars and not
by phoebus hethat wandering knight so fair and
i prithee sweet wag when thou art king as god
save thy grace majesty i should say for grace
thou wilt have none 


prince henry

what none


falstaff

no by my troth not so much as will serve to
prologue to an egg and butter


prince henry

well how then come roundly roundly


falstaff

marry then sweet wag when thou art king let not
us that are squires of the night body be called
thieves of the day beauty let us be diana
foresters gentlemen of the shade minions of the
moon and let men say we be men of good government
being governed as the sea is by our noble and
chaste mistress the moon under whose countenance we steal


prince henry

thou sayest well and it holds well too for the
fortune of us that are the moon men doth ebb and
flow like the sea being governed as the sea is
by the moon as for proof now a purse of gold
most resolutely snatched on monday night and most
dissolutely spent on tuesday morning got with
swearing lay by and spent with crying bring in
now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows


falstaff

by the lord thou sayest true lad and is not my
hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench


prince henry

as the honey of hybla my old lad of the castle and
is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance


falstaff

how now how now mad wag what in thy quips and
thy quiddities what a plague have i to do with a
buff jerkin


prince henry

why what a pox have i to do with my hostess of the tavern


falstaff

well thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
time and oft


prince henry

did i ever call for thee to pay thy part


falstaff

no ill give thee thy due thou hast paid all there


prince henry

yea and elsewhere so far as my coin would stretch
and where it would not i have used my credit


falstaff

yea and so used it that were it not here apparent
that thou art heir apparent but i prithee sweet
wag shall there be gallows standing in england when
thou art king and resolution thus fobbed as it is
with the rusty curb of old father antic the law do
not thou when thou art king hang a thief


prince henry

no thou shalt


falstaff

prince henry

thou judgest false already i mean thou shalt have
the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman


falstaff

well hal well and in some sort it jumps with my
humour as well as waiting in the court i can tell
you


prince henry

for obtaining of suits


falstaff

yea for obtaining of suits whereof the hangman
hath no lean wardrobe blood i am as melancholy
as a gib cat or a lugged bear


prince henry

or an old lion or a lover lute


falstaff

yea or the drone of a lincolnshire bagpipe


prince henry

what sayest thou to a hare or the melancholy of
moor-ditch


falstaff

thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
the most comparative rascalliest sweet young
prince but hal i prithee trouble me no more
with vanity i would to god thou and i knew where a
commodity of good names were to be bought an old
lord of the council rated me the other day in the
street about you sir but i marked him not and yet
he talked very wisely but i regarded him not and
yet he talked wisely and in the street too


prince henry

thou didst well for wisdom cries out in the
streets and no man regards it


falstaff

o thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
to corrupt a saint thou hast done much harm upon
me hal god forgive thee for it before i knew
thee hal i knew nothing and now am i if a man
should speak truly little better than one of the
wicked i must give over this life and i will give
it over by the lord and i do not i am a villain
ill be damned for never a king son in
christendom


prince henry

where shall we take a purse tomorrow jack


falstaff

zounds where thou wilt lad ill make one an i
do not call me villain and baffle me


prince henry

to purse-taking


falstaff

man to labour in his vocation
enter poins

match o if men were to be saved by merit what
hole in hell were hot enough for him this is the
most omnipotent villain that ever cried and to
a true man


prince henry

poins

good morrow sweet hal what says monsieur remorse
what says sir john sack and sugar jack how
agrees the devil and thee about thy soul that thou
soldest him on good-friday last for a cup of madeira
and a cold capon leg


prince henry

sir john stands to his word the devil shall have
his bargain for he was never yet a breaker of
proverbs he will give the devil his due


poins

prince henry

else he had been damned for cozening the devil


poins

but my lads my lads to-morrow morning by four
oclock early at gadshill there are pilgrims going
to canterbury with rich offerings and traders
riding to london with fat purses i have vizards
for you all you have horses for yourselves

supper to-morrow night in eastcheap we may do it
as secure as sleep if you will go i will stuff

at home and be hanged


falstaff

prince henry

fellowship in thee nor thou camest not of the blood
royal if thou darest not stand for ten shillings


prince henry

falstaff

by the lord ill be a traitor then when thou art king


prince henry

i care not


poins

sir john i prithee leave the prince and me alone
i will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
that he shall go


falstaff

well god give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
the ears of profiting that what thou speakest may
move and what he hears may be believed that the
true prince may for recreation sake prove a false
thief for the poor abuses of the time want
countenance farewell you shall find me in eastcheap


prince henry

farewell thou latter spring farewell all-hallown summer
exit falstaff


poins

now my good sweet honey lord ride with us
to-morrow i have a jest to execute that i cannot
manage alone falstaff bardolph peto and gadshill
shall rob those men that we have already waylaid
yourself and i will not be there and when they
have the booty if you and i do not rob them cut
this head off from my shoulders


prince henry

how shall we part with them in setting forth


poins

why we will set forth before or after them and
appoint them a place of meeting wherein it is at
our pleasure to fail and then will they adventure
upon the exploit themselves which they shall have
no sooner achieved but well set upon them


prince henry

yea but tis like that they will know us by our
horses by our habits and by every other
appointment to be ourselves


poins

tut our horses they shall not see ill tie them
in the wood our vizards we will change after we
leave them and sirrah i have cases of buckram
for the nonce to immask our noted outward garments


prince henry

yea but i doubt they will be too hard for us


poins

well for two of them i know them to be as
true-bred cowards as ever turned back and for the
third if he fight longer than he sees reason ill
forswear arms the virtue of this jest will be the
incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
tell us when we meet at supper how thirty at
least he fought with what wards what blows what
extremities he endured and in the reproof of this
lies the jest


prince henry

well ill go with thee provide us all things
necessary and meet me to-morrow night in eastcheap
there ill sup farewell


poins

farewell my lord
exit poins


prince henry

i know you all and will awhile uphold
the unyoked humour of your idleness
yet herein will i imitate the sun
who doth permit the base contagious clouds
to smother up his beauty from the world
that when he please again to be himself
being wanted he may be more wonder at
by breaking through the foul and ugly mists
of vapours that did seem to strangle him
if all the year were playing holidays
to sport would be as tedious as to work
but when they seldom come they wish for come
and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents
so when this loose behavior i throw off
and pay the debt i never promised
by how much better than my word i am
by so much shall i falsify men hopes
and like bright metal on a sullen ground
my reformation glittering oer my fault
shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
than that which hath no foil to set it off
ill so offend to make offence a skill
redeeming time when men think least i will
exit

scene iii london the palace

enter the king northumberland worcester hotspur sir walter blunt with others


king henry iv

my blood hath been too cold and temperate
unapt to stir at these indignities
and you have found me for accordingly
you tread upon my patience but be sure
i will from henceforth rather be myself
mighty and to be fear than my condition
which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down
and therefore lost that title of respect
which the proud soul neer pays but to the proud


earl of worcester

our house my sovereign liege little deserves
the scourge of greatness to be used on it
and that same greatness too which our own hands
have holp to make so portly


northumberland

my lord 


king henry iv

worcester get thee gone for i do see
danger and disobedience in thine eye
o sir your presence is too bold and peremptory
and majesty might never yet endure
the moody frontier of a servant brow
you have good leave to leave us when we need
your use and counsel we shall send for you
exit worcester
you were about to speak
to north


northumberland

yea my good lord
those prisoners in your highness name demanded
which harry percy here at holmedon took
were as he says not with such strength denied
as is deliver to your majesty
either envy therefore or misprison
is guilty of this fault and not my son


hotspur

my liege i did deny no prisoners
but i remember when the fight was done
when i was dry with rage and extreme toil
breathless and faint leaning upon my sword
came there a certain lord neat and trimly dress
fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reap
show like a stubble-land at harvest-home
he was perfumed like a milliner
and twixt his finger and his thumb he held
a pouncet-box which ever and anon
he gave his nose and tookt away again
who therewith angry when it next came there
took it in snuff and still he smiled and talk
and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by
he call them untaught knaves unmannerly
to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
betwixt the wind and his nobility
with many holiday and lady terms
he question me amongst the rest demanded
my prisoners in your majesty behalf
i then all smarting with my wounds being cold
to be so pester with a popinjay
out of my grief and my impatience
answer neglectingly i know not what
he should or he should not for he made me mad
to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
and talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
of guns and drums and wounds god save the mark 
and telling me the sovereign thing on earth
was parmaceti for an inward bruise
and that it was great pity so it was
this villanous salt-petre should be digg
out of the bowels of the harmless earth
which many a good tall fellow had destroy
so cowardly and but for these vile guns
he would himself have been a soldier
this bald unjointed chat of his my lord
i answer indirectly as i said
and i beseech you let not his report
come current for an accusation
betwixt my love and your high majesty


sir walter blunt

the circumstance consider good my lord
whateer lord harry percy then had said
to such a person and in such a place
at such a time with all the rest retold
may reasonably die and never rise
to do him wrong or any way impeach
what then he said so he unsay it now


king henry iv

why yet he doth deny his prisoners
but with proviso and exception
that we at our own charge shall ransom straight
his brother-in-law the foolish mortimer
who on my soul hath wilfully betray
the lives of those that he did lead to fight
against that great magician damn glendower
whose daughter as we hear the earl of march
hath lately married shall our coffers then
be emptied to redeem a traitor home
shall we but treason and indent with fears
when they have lost and forfeited themselves
no on the barren mountains let him starve
for i shall never hold that man my friend
whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
to ransom home revolted mortimer


hotspur

revolted mortimer
he never did fall off my sovereign liege
but by the chance of war to prove that true
needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds
those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took
when on the gentle severn sedgy bank
in single opposition hand to hand
he did confound the best part of an hour
in changing hardiment with great glendower
three times they breathed and three times did
they drink
upon agreement of swift severn flood
who then affrighted with their bloody looks
ran fearfully among the trembling reeds
and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank
bloodstained with these valiant combatants
never did base and rotten policy
colour her working with such deadly wounds
nor could the noble mortimer
receive so many and all willingly
then let not him be slander with revolt


king henry iv

thou dost belie him percy thou dost belie him
he never did encounter with glendower
i tell thee
he durst as well have met the devil alone
as owen glendower for an enemy
art thou not ashamed but sirrah henceforth
let me not hear you speak of mortimer
send me your prisoners with the speediest means
or you shall hear in such a kind from me
as will displease you my lord northumberland
we licence your departure with your son
send us your prisoners or you will hear of it
exeunt king henry blunt and train


hotspur

an if the devil come and roar for them
i will not send them i will after straight
and tell him so for i will ease my heart
albeit i make a hazard of my head


northumberland

what drunk with choler stay and pause awhile
here comes your uncle
re-enter worcester


hotspur

speak of mortimer
zounds i will speak of him and let my soul
want mercy if i do not join with him
yea on his part ill empty all these veins
and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust
but i will lift the down-trod mortimer
as high in the air as this unthankful king
as this ingrate and canker bolingbroke


northumberland

brother the king hath made your nephew mad


earl of worcester

who struck this heat up after i was gone


hotspur

he will forsooth have all my prisoners
and when i urged the ransom once again
of my wife brother then his cheek look pale
and on my face he turn an eye of death
trembling even at the name of mortimer


earl of worcester

i cannot blame him was not he proclaim
by richard that dead is the next of blood


northumberland

he was i heard the proclamation
and then it was when the unhappy king
 whose wrongs in us god pardon did set forth
upon his irish expedition
from whence he intercepted did return
to be deposed and shortly murdered


earl of worcester

and for whose death we in the world wide mouth
live scandalized and foully spoken of


hotspur

but soft i pray you did king richard then
proclaim my brother edmund mortimer
heir to the crown


northumberland

he did myself did hear it


hotspur

nay then i cannot blame his cousin king
that wished him on the barren mountains starve
but shall it be that you that set the crown
upon the head of this forgetful man
and for his sake wear the detested blot
of murderous subornation shall it be
that you a world of curses undergo
being the agents or base second means
the cords the ladder or the hangman rather
o pardon me that i descend so low
to show the line and the predicament
wherein you range under this subtle king
shall it for shame be spoken in these days
or fill up chronicles in time to come
that men of your nobility and power
did gage them both in an unjust behalf
as both of you god pardon it have done
to put down richard that sweet lovely rose
an plant this thorn this canker bolingbroke
and shall it in more shame be further spoken
that you are fool discarded and shook off
by him for whom these shames ye underwent
no yet time serves wherein you may redeem
your banish honours and restore yourselves
into the good thoughts of the world again
revenge the jeering and disdain contempt
of this proud king who studies day and night
to answer all the debt he owes to you
even with the bloody payment of your deaths
therefore i say 


earl of worcester

peace cousin say no more
and now i will unclasp a secret book
and to your quick-conceiving discontents
ill read you matter deep and dangerous
as full of peril and adventurous spirit
as to oer-walk a current roaring loud
on the unsteadfast footing of a spear


hotspur

if he fall in good night or sink or swim
send danger from the east unto the west
so honour cross it from the north to south
and let them grapple o the blood more stirs
to rouse a lion than to start a hare


northumberland

imagination of some great exploit
drives him beyond the bounds of patience


hotspur

by heaven methinks it were an easy leap
to pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon
or dive into the bottom of the deep
where fathom-line could never touch the ground
and pluck up drowned honour by the locks
so he that doth redeem her thence might wear
without corrival all her dignities
but out upon this half-faced fellowship


earl of worcester

he apprehends a world of figures here
but not the form of what he should attend
good cousin give me audience for a while


hotspur

i cry you mercy


earl of worcester

those same noble scots
that are your prisoners 


hotspur

ill keep them all
by god he shall not have a scot of them
no if a scot would save his soul he shall not
ill keep them by this hand


earl of worcester

you start away
and lend no ear unto my purposes
those prisoners you shall keep


hotspur

nay i will that flat
he said he would not ransom mortimer
forbad my tongue to speak of mortimer
but i will find him when he lies asleep
and in his ear ill holla mortimer
nay
ill have a starling shall be taught to speak
nothing but mortimer and give it him
to keep his anger still in motion


earl of worcester

hear you cousin a word


hotspur

all studies here i solemnly defy
save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke
and that same sword-and-buckler prince of wales
but that i think his father loves him not
and would be glad he met with some mischance
i would have him poison with a pot of ale


earl of worcester

farewell kinsman ill talk to you
when you are better temper to attend


northumberland

why what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
art thou to break into this woman mood
tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own


hotspur

why look you i am whipp and scourged with rods
nettled and stung with pismires when i hear
of this vile politician bolingbroke
in richard time what do you call the place 
a plague upon it it is in gloucestershire
twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept
his uncle york where i first bow my knee
unto this king of smiles this bolingbroke 
blood 
when you and he came back from ravenspurgh


northumberland

at berkley castle


hotspur

you say true
why what a candy deal of courtesy
this fawning greyhound then did proffer me
lookwhen his infant fortune came to age
and gentle harry percy and kind cousin
o the devil take such cozeners god forgive me
good uncle tell your tale i have done


earl of worcester

nay if you have not to it again
we will stay your leisure


hotspur

i have done i faith


earl of worcester

then once more to your scottish prisoners
deliver them up without their ransom straight
and make the douglas son your only mean
for powers in scotland which for divers reasons
which i shall send you written be assured
will easily be granted you my lord
to northumberland
your son in scotland being thus employ
shall secretly into the bosom creep
of that same noble prelate well beloved
the archbishop


hotspur

of york is it not


earl of worcester

true who bears hard
his brother death at bristol the lord scroop
i speak not this in estimation
as what i think might be but what i know
is ruminated plotted and set down
and only stays but to behold the face
of that occasion that shall bring it on


hotspur

i smell it upon my life it will do well


northumberland

before the game is afoot thou still let slip


hotspur

why it cannot choose but be a noble plot
and then the power of scotland and of york
to join with mortimer ha


earl of worcester

and so they shall


hotspur

in faith it is exceedingly well aim


earl of worcester

and tis no little reason bids us speed
to save our heads by raising of a head
for bear ourselves as even as we can
the king will always think him in our debt
and think we think ourselves unsatisfied
till he hath found a time to pay us home
and see already how he doth begin
to make us strangers to his looks of love


hotspur

he does he does well be revenged on him


earl of worcester

cousin farewell no further go in this
than i by letters shall direct your course
when time is ripe which will be suddenly
ill steal to glendower and lord mortimer
where you and douglas and our powers at once
as i will fashion it shall happily meet
to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms
which now we hold at much uncertainty


northumberland

farewell good brother we shall thrive i trust


hotspur

uncle adieu o let the hours be short
till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport

thy stomach pleasure and thy golden sleep

why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks
and given my treasures and my rights of thee

in thy faint slumbers i by thee have watch
and heard thee murmur tales of iron wars
speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed
cry courage to the field and thou hast talk
of sallies and retires of trenches tents
of palisadoes frontiers parapets
of basilisks of cannon culverin
of prisoners ransom and of soldiers slain
and all the currents of a heady fight
thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
and thus hath so bestirr thee in thy sleep
that beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream
and in thy face strange motions have appear
such as we see when men restrain their breath

time but also how thou art accompanied for though
the camomile the more it is trodden on the faster
it grows yet youth the more it is wasted the
sooner it wears that thou art my son i have
partly thy mother word partly my own opinion
but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
foolish-hanging of thy nether lip that doth warrant
me if then thou be son to me here lies the point
why being son to me art thou so pointed at shall
the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
blackberries a question not to be asked shall
the sun of england prove a thief and take purses a
question to be asked there is a thing harry
which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
many in our land by the name of pitch this pitch
as ancient writers do report doth defile so doth
the company thou keepest for harry now i do not
speak to thee in drink but in tears not in

woes also and yet there is a virtuous man whom i
have often noted in thy company but i know not his name

cheerful look a pleasing eye and a most noble
carriage and as i think his age some fifty or
byr lady inclining to three score and now i
remember me his name is falstaff if that man
should be lewdly given he deceiveth me for harry

falstaff him keep with the rest banish and tell

bolting-hutch of beastliness that swollen parcel
of dropsies that huge bombard of sack that stuffed
cloak-bag of guts that roasted manningtree ox with
the pudding in his belly that reverend vice that
grey iniquity that father ruffian that vanity in
years wherein is he good but to taste sack and
drink it wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a
capon and eat it wherein cunning but in craft
wherein crafty but in villany wherein villanous

act iii
scene i bangor the archdeacon house

enter hotspur worcester mortimer and glendower


mortimer

these promises are fair the parties sure
and our induction full of prosperous hope


hotspur

lord mortimer and cousin glendower
will you sit down
and uncle worcester a plague upon it
i have forgot the map


glendower

no here it is
sit cousin percy sit good cousin hotspur
for by that name as oft as lancaster
doth speak of you his cheek looks pale and with
a rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven


hotspur

and you in hell as oft as he hears owen glendower spoke of


glendower

i cannot blame him at my nativity
the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
of burning cressets and at my birth
the frame and huge foundation of the earth
shaked like a coward


hotspur

why so it would have done at the same season if
your mother cat had but kittened though yourself
had never been born


glendower

i say the earth did shake when i was born


hotspur

and i say the earth was not of my mind
if you suppose as fearing you it shook


glendower

the heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble


hotspur

o then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire
and not in fear of your nativity
diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
in strange eruptions oft the teeming earth
is with a kind of colic pinch and vex
by the imprisoning of unruly wind
within her womb which for enlargement striving
shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
steeples and moss-grown towers at your birth
our grandam earth having this distemperature
in passion shook


glendower

cousin of many men
i do not bear these crossings give me leave
to tell you once again that at my birth
the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
the goats ran from the mountains and the herds
were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields
these signs have mark me extraordinary
and all the courses of my life do show
i am not in the roll of common men
where is he living clipp in with the sea
that chides the banks of england scotland wales
which calls me pupil or hath read to me
and bring him out that is but woman son
can trace me in the tedious ways of art
and hold me pace in deep experiments


hotspur

i think there no man speaks better welsh
ill to dinner


mortimer

peace cousin percy you will make him mad


glendower

i can call spirits from the vasty deep


hotspur

why so can i or so can any man
but will they come when you do call for them


glendower

why i can teach you cousin to command
the devil


hotspur

and i can teach thee coz to shame the devil
by telling truth tell truth and shame the devil
if thou have power to raise him bring him hither
and ill be sworn i have power to shame him hence
o while you live tell truth and shame the devil


mortimer

come come no more of this unprofitable chat


glendower

three times hath henry bolingbroke made head
against my power thrice from the banks of wye
and sandy-bottom severn have i sent him
bootless home and weather-beaten back


hotspur

home without boots and in foul weather too
how capes he agues in the devil name


glendower

come here the map shall we divide our right
according to our threefold order taen


mortimer

the archdeacon hath divided it
into three limits very equally
england from trent and severn hitherto
by south and east is to my part assign
all westward wales beyond the severn shore
and all the fertile land within that bound
to owen glendower and dear coz to you
the remnant northward lying off from trent
and our indentures tripartite are drawn
which being sealed interchangeably
a business that this night may execute
to-morrow cousin percy you and i
and my good lord of worcester will set forth
to meet your father and the scottish power
as is appointed us at shrewsbury
my father glendower is not ready yet
not shall we need his help these fourteen days
within that space you may have drawn together
your tenants friends and neighbouring gentlemen


glendower

a shorter time shall send me to you lords
and in my conduct shall your ladies come
from whom you now must steal and take no leave
for there will be a world of water shed
upon the parting of your wives and you


hotspur

methinks my moiety north from burton here
in quantity equals not one of yours
see how this river comes me cranking in
and cuts me from the best of all my land
a huge half-moon a monstrous cantle out
ill have the current in this place damm up
and here the smug and silver trent shall run
in a new channel fair and evenly
it shall not wind with such a deep indent
to rob me of so rich a bottom here


glendower

not wind it shall it must you see it doth


mortimer

yea but
mark how he bears his course and runs me up
with like advantage on the other side
gelding the opposed continent as much
as on the other side it takes from you


earl of worcester

yea but a little charge will trench him here
and on this north side win this cape of land
and then he runs straight and even


hotspur

ill have it so a little charge will do it


glendower

ill not have it alter


hotspur

will not you


glendower

no nor you shall not


hotspur

who shall say me nay


glendower

why that will i


hotspur

let me not understand you then speak it in welsh


glendower

i can speak english lord as well as you
for i was train up in the english court
where being but young i framed to the harp
many an english ditty lovely well
and gave the tongue a helpful ornament
a virtue that was never seen in you


hotspur

marry
and i am glad of it with all my heart
i had rather be a kitten and cry mew
than one of these same metre ballad-mongers
i had rather hear a brazen canstick turn
or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree
and that would set my teeth nothing on edge
nothing so much as mincing poetry
tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag


glendower

come you shall have trent turn


hotspur

i do not care ill give thrice so much land
to any well-deserving friend
but in the way of bargain mark ye me
ill cavil on the ninth part of a hair
are the indentures drawn shall we be gone


glendower

the moon shines fair you may away by night
ill haste the writer and withal
break with your wives of your departure hence
i am afraid my daughter will run mad
so much she doteth on her mortimer
exit glendower


mortimer

fie cousin percy how you cross my father


hotspur

i cannot choose sometime he angers me
with telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant
of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies
and of a dragon and a finless fish
a clip-wing griffin and a moulten raven
a couching lion and a ramping cat
and such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
as puts me from my faith i tell you what
he held me last night at least nine hours
in reckoning up the several devils names
that were his lackeys i cried hum and well go to
but mark him not a word o he is as tedious
as a tired horse a railing wife
worse than a smoky house i had rather live
with cheese and garlic in a windmill far
than feed on cates and have him talk to me
in any summer-house in christendom


mortimer

in faith he is a worthy gentleman
exceedingly well read and profited
in strange concealments valiant as a lion
and as wondrous affable and as bountiful
as mines of india shall i tell you cousin
he holds your temper in a high respect
and curbs himself even of his natural scope
when you come cross his humour faith he does
i warrant you that man is not alive
might so have tempted him as you have done
without the taste of danger and reproof
but do not use it oft let me entreat you


earl of worcester

in faith my lord you are too wilful-blame
and since your coming hither have done enough
to put him quite beside his patience
you must needs learn lord to amend this fault
though sometimes it show greatness courage blood 
and that the dearest grace it renders you 
yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage
defect of manners want of government
pride haughtiness opinion and disdain
the least of which haunting a nobleman
loseth men hearts and leaves behind a stain
upon the beauty of all parts besides
beguiling them of commendation


hotspur

well i am school good manners be your speed
here come our wives and let us take our leave
re-enter glendower with the ladies


mortimer

this is the deadly spite that angers me
my wife can speak no english i no welsh


glendower

my daughter weeps she will not part with you
shell be a soldier too shell to the wars


mortimer

good father tell her that she and my aunt percy
shall follow in your conduct speedily
glendower speaks to her in welsh and she answers him in the same


glendower

she is desperate here a peevish self-wind harlotry
one that no persuasion can do good upon
the lady speaks in welsh


mortimer

i understand thy looks that pretty welsh
which thou pour down from these swelling heavens
i am too perfect in and but for shame
in such a parley should i answer thee
the lady speaks again in welsh
i understand thy kisses and thou mine
and that a feeling disputation
but i will never be a truant love
till i have learned thy language for thy tongue
makes welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn
sung by a fair queen in a summer bower
with ravishing division to her lute


glendower

nay if you melt then will she run mad
the lady speaks again in welsh


mortimer

o i am ignorance itself in this


glendower

she bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
and rest your gentle head upon her lap
and she will sing the song that pleaseth you
and on your eyelids crown the god of sleep
charming your blood with pleasing heaviness
making such difference twixt wake and sleep
as is the difference betwixt day and night
the hour before the heavenly-harness team
begins his golden progress in the east


mortimer

with all my heart ill sit and hear her sing
by that time will our book i think be drawn


glendower

do so
and those musicians that shall play to you
hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence
and straight they shall be here sit and attend


hotspur

come kate thou art perfect in lying down come
quick quick that i may lay my head in thy lap


lady percy

go ye giddy goose
the music plays


hotspur

now i perceive the devil understands welsh
and tis no marvel he is so humorous
byr lady he is a good musician


lady percy

then should you be nothing but musical for you are
altogether governed by humours lie still ye thief
and hear the lady sing in welsh


hotspur

i had rather hear lady my brach howl in irish


lady percy

wouldst thou have thy head broken


hotspur

no


lady percy

then be still


hotspur

neithertis a woman fault


lady percy

now god help thee


hotspur

to the welsh lady bed


lady percy

what that


hotspur

peace she sings
here the lady sings a welsh song


hotspur

come kate ill have your song too


lady percy

not mine in good sooth


hotspur

not yours in good sooth heart you swear like a
comfit-maker wife not you in good sooth and
as true as i live and as god shall mend me and
as sure as day
and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths
as if thou never walk further than finsbury
swear me kate like a lady as thou art
a good mouth-filling oath and leave in sooth
and such protest of pepper-gingerbread
to velvet-guards and sunday-citizens
come sing


lady percy

i will not sing


hotspur

tis the next way to turn tailor or be red-breast
teacher an the indentures be drawn ill away
within these two hours and so come in when ye will
exit


glendower

come come lord mortimer you are as slow
as hot lord percy is on fire to go
by this our book is drawn well but seal
and then to horse immediately


mortimer

with all my heart
exeunt

scene ii london the palace

enter king henry iv prince henry and others


king henry iv

lords give us leave the prince of wales and i
must have some private conference but be near at hand
for we shall presently have need of you
exeunt lords
i know not whether god will have it so
for some displeasing service i have done
that in his secret doom out of my blood
hell breed revengement and a scourge for me
but thou dost in thy passages of life
make me believe that thou art only mark
for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
to punish my mistreadings tell me else
could such inordinate and low desires
such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts
such barren pleasures rude society
as thou art match withal and grafted to
accompany the greatness of thy blood
and hold their level with thy princely heart


prince henry

so please your majesty i would i could
quit all offences with as clear excuse
as well as i am doubtless i can purge
myself of many i am charged withal
yet such extenuation let me beg
as in reproof of many tales devised
which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear
by smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers
i may for some things true wherein my youth
hath faulty wander and irregular
find pardon on my true submission


king henry iv

god pardon thee yet let me wonder harry
at thy affections which do hold a wing
quite from the flight of all thy ancestors
thy place in council thou hast rudely lost
which by thy younger brother is supplied
and art almost an alien to the hearts
of all the court and princes of my blood
the hope and expectation of thy time
is ruin and the soul of every man
prophetically doth forethink thy fall
had i so lavish of my presence been
so common-hackney in the eyes of men
so stale and cheap to vulgar company
opinion that did help me to the crown
had still kept loyal to possession
and left me in reputeless banishment
a fellow of no mark nor likelihood
by being seldom seen i could not stir
but like a comet i was wonder at
that men would tell their children this is he
others would say where which is bolingbroke
and then i stole all courtesy from heaven
and dress myself in such humility
that i did pluck allegiance from men hearts
loud shouts and salutations from their mouths
even in the presence of the crowned king
thus did i keep my person fresh and new
my presence like a robe pontifical
neer seen but wonder at and so my state
seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast
and won by rareness such solemnity
the skipping king he ambled up and down
with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits
soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state
mingled his royalty with capering fools
had his great name profaned with their scorns
and gave his countenance against his name
to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
of every beardless vain comparative
grew a companion to the common streets
enfeoff himself to popularity
that being daily swallow by men eyes
they surfeited with honey and began
to loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little
more than a little is by much too much
so when he had occasion to be seen
he was but as the cuckoo is in june
heard not regarded seen but with such eyes
as sick and blunted with community
afford no extraordinary gaze
such as is bent on sun-like majesty
when it shines seldom in admiring eyes
but rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down
slept in his face and render such aspect
as cloudy men use to their adversaries
being with his presence glutted gorged and full
and in that very line harry standest thou
for thou has lost thy princely privilege
with vile participation not an eye
but is a-weary of thy common sight
save mine which hath desired to see thee more
which now doth that i would not have it do
make blind itself with foolish tenderness


prince henry

i shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord
be more myself


king henry iv

for all the world
as thou art to this hour was richard then
when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh
and even as i was then is percy now
now by my sceptre and my soul to boot
he hath more worthy interest to the state
than thou the shadow of succession
for of no right nor colour like to right
he doth fill fields with harness in the realm
turns head against the lion armed jaws
and being no more in debt to years than thou
leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
to bloody battles and to bruising arms
what never-dying honour hath he got
against renowned douglas whose high deeds
whose hot incursions and great name in arms
holds from all soldiers chief majority
and military title capital
through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ
thrice hath this hotspur mars in swathling clothes
this infant warrior in his enterprises
discomfited great douglas taen him once
enlarged him and made a friend of him
to fill the mouth of deep defiance up
and shake the peace and safety of our throne
and what say you to this percy northumberland
the archbishop grace of york douglas mortimer
capitulate against us and are up
but wherefore do i tell these news to thee
why harry do i tell thee of my foes
which art my near and dearest enemy
thou that art like enough through vassal fear
base inclination and the start of spleen
to fight against me under percy pay
to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns
to show how much thou art degenerate


prince henry

do not think so you shall not find it so
and god forgive them that so much have sway
your majesty good thoughts away from me
i will redeem all this on percy head
and in the closing of some glorious day
be bold to tell you that i am your son
when i will wear a garment all of blood
and stain my favours in a bloody mask
which wash away shall scour my shame with it
and that shall be the day wheneer it lights
that this same child of honour and renown
this gallant hotspur this all-praised knight
and your unthought-of harry chance to meet
for every honour sitting on his helm
would they were multitudes and on my head
my shames redoubled for the time will come
that i shall make this northern youth exchange
his glorious deeds for my indignities
percy is but my factor good my lord
to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf
and i will call him to so strict account
that he shall render every glory up
yea even the slightest worship of his time
or i will tear the reckoning from his heart
this in the name of god i promise here
the which if he be pleased i shall perform
i do beseech your majesty may salve
the long-grown wounds of my intemperance
if not the end of life cancels all bands
and i will die a hundred thousand deaths
ere break the smallest parcel of this vow


king henry iv

a hundred thousand rebels die in this
thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein
enter blunt
how now good blunt thy looks are full of speed


sir walter blunt

so hath the business that i come to speak of
lord mortimer of scotland hath sent word
that douglas and the english rebels met
the eleventh of this month at shrewsbury
a mighty and a fearful head they are
if promises be kept on every hand
as ever offer foul play in the state


king henry iv

the earl of westmoreland set forth to-day
with him my son lord john of lancaster
for this advertisement is five days old
on wednesday next harry you shall set forward
on thursday we ourselves will march our meeting
is bridgenorth and harry you shall march
through gloucestershire by which account
our business valued some twelve days hence
our general forces at bridgenorth shall meet
our hands are full of business let away
advantage feeds him fat while men delay

act iv
scene i the rebel camp near shrewsbury

enter hotspur worcester and douglas


hotspur

well said my noble scot if speaking truth
in this fine age were not thought flattery
such attribution should the douglas have
as not a soldier of this season stamp
should go so general current through the world
by god i cannot flatter i do defy
the tongues of soothers but a braver place
in my heart love hath no man than yourself
nay task me to my word approve me lord


earl of douglas

thou art the king of honour
no man so potent breathes upon the ground
but i will beard him


hotspur

do so and tis well
enter a messenger with letters
what letters hast thou there i can but thank you


messenger

these letters come from your father


hotspur

letters from him why comes he not himself


messenger

he cannot come my lord he is grievous sick


hotspur

zounds how has he the leisure to be sick
in such a rustling time who leads his power
under whose government come they along


messenger

his letters bear his mind not i my lord


earl of worcester

i prithee tell me doth he keep his bed


messenger

he did my lord four days ere i set forth
and at the time of my departure thence
he was much fear by his physicians


earl of worcester

i would the state of time had first been whole
ere he by sickness had been visited
his health was never better worth than now


hotspur

sick now droop now this sickness doth infect
the very life-blood of our enterprise
tis catching hither even to our camp
he writes me here that inward sickness 
and that his friends by deputation could not
so soon be drawn nor did he think it meet
to lay so dangerous and dear a trust
on any soul removed but on his own
yet doth he give us bold advertisement
that with our small conjunction we should on
to see how fortune is disposed to us
for as he writes there is no quailing now
because the king is certainly possess
of all our purposes what say you to it


earl of worcester

your father sickness is a maim to us


hotspur

a perilous gash a very limb lopp off
and yet in faith it is not his present want
seems more than we shall find it were it good
to set the exact wealth of all our states
all at one cast to set so rich a main
on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour
it were not good for therein should we read
the very bottom and the soul of hope
the very list the very utmost bound
of all our fortunes


earl of douglas

faith and so we should
where now remains a sweet reversion
we may boldly spend upon the hope of what
is to come in
a comfort of retirement lives in this


hotspur

a rendezvous a home to fly unto
if that the devil and mischance look big
upon the maidenhead of our affairs


earl of worcester

but yet i would your father had been here
the quality and hair of our attempt
brooks no division it will be thought
by some that know not why he is away
that wisdom loyalty and mere dislike
of our proceedings kept the earl from hence
and think how such an apprehension
may turn the tide of fearful faction
and breed a kind of question in our cause
for well you know we of the offering side
must keep aloof from strict arbitrement
and stop all sight-holes every loop from whence
the eye of reason may pry in upon us
this absence of your father draws a curtain
that shows the ignorant a kind of fear
before not dreamt of


hotspur

you strain too far
i rather of his absence make this use
it lends a lustre and more great opinion
a larger dare to our great enterprise
than if the earl were here for men must think
if we without his help can make a head
to push against a kingdom with his help
we shall oerturn it topsy-turvy down
yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole


earl of douglas

as heart can think there is not such a word
spoke of in scotland as this term of fear
enter sir richard vernon


hotspur

my cousin vernon welcome by my soul


vernon

hotspur

he shall be welcome too where is his son
the nimble-footed madcap prince of wales
and his comrades that daff the world aside
and bid it pass


vernon

all furnish all in arms
all plumed like estridges that with the wind
baited like eagles having lately bathed
glittering in golden coats like images
as full of spirit as the month of may
and gorgeous as the sun at midsummer
wanton as youthful goats wild as young bulls
i saw young harry with his beaver on
his cuisses on his thighs gallantly arm
rise from the ground like feather mercury
and vaulted with such ease into his seat
as if an angel dropp down from the clouds
to turn and wind a fiery pegasus
and witch the world with noble horsemanship


hotspur

no more no more worse than the sun in march
this praise doth nourish agues let them come
they come like sacrifices in their trim
and to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war
all hot and bleeding will we offer them
the mailed mars shall on his altar sit
up to the ears in blood i am on fire
to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
and yet not ours come let me taste my horse
who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
against the bosom of the prince of wales
harry to harry shall hot horse to horse
meet and neer part till one drop down a corse
o that glendower were come


vernon

there is more news
i learn in worcester as i rode along
he cannot draw his power this fourteen days


earl of douglas

that the worst tidings that i hear of yet


worcester

ay by my faith that bears a frosty sound


hotspur

what may the king whole battle reach unto


vernon

to thirty thousand


hotspur

forty let it be
my father and glendower being both away
the powers of us may serve so great a day
come let us take a muster speedily
doomsday is near die all die merrily


earl of douglas

talk not of dying i am out of fear
of death or death hand for this one-half year

younger brothers revolted tapsters and ostlers
trade-fallen the cankers of a calm world and a
long peace ten times more dishonourable ragged than

the rooms of them that have bought out their
services that you would think that i had a hundred

swine-keeping from eating draff and husks a mad
fellow met me on the way and told me i had unloaded
all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies no eye
hath seen such scarecrows ill not march through
coventry with them that flat nay and the
villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had
gyves on for indeed i had the most of them out of
prison there but a shirt and a half in all my
company and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
together and thrown over the shoulders like an
herald coat without sleeves and the shirt to say

earl of worcester

good cousin be advised stir not tonight

vernon

and i dare well maintain it with my life
if well-respected honour bid me on
i hold as little counsel with weak fear
as you my lord or any scot that this day lives
let it be seen to-morrow in the battle
which of us fears


earl of douglas

yea or to-night

hotspur

to-night say i


vernon

come come it nay not be i wonder much
being men of such great leading as you are
that you foresee not what impediments
drag back our expedition certain horse
of my cousin vernon are not yet come up
your uncle worcester horse came but today
and now their pride and mettle is asleep
their courage with hard labour tame and dull
that not a horse is half the half of himself


hotspur

so are the horses of the enemy
in general journey-bated and brought low
the better part of ours are full of rest


earl of worcester

the number of the king exceedeth ours
for god sake cousin stay till all come in
the trumpet sounds a parley
enter sir walter blunt


sir walter blunt

i come with gracious offers from the king
if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect


hotspur

welcome sir walter blunt and would to god
you were of our determination
some of us love you well and even those some
envy your great deservings and good name
because you are not of our quality
but stand against us like an enemy


sir walter blunt

and god defend but still i should stand so
so long as out of limit and true rule
you stand against anointed majesty
but to my charge the king hath sent to know
the nature of your griefs and whereupon
you conjure from the breast of civil peace
such bold hostility teaching his duteous land
audacious cruelty if that the king
have any way your good deserts forgot
which he confesseth to be manifold
he bids you name your griefs and with all speed
you shall have your desires with interest
and pardon absolute for yourself and these
herein misled by your suggestion


hotspur

the king is kind and well we know the king
knows at what time to promise when to pay
my father and my uncle and myself
did give him that same royalty he wears
and when he was not six and twenty strong
sick in the world regard wretched and low
a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home
my father gave him welcome to the shore
and when he heard him swear and vow to god
he came but to be duke of lancaster
to sue his livery and beg his peace
with tears of innocency and terms of zeal
my father in kind heart and pity moved
swore him assistance and perform it too
now when the lords and barons of the realm
perceived northumberland did lean to him
the more and less came in with cap and knee
met him in boroughs cities villages
attended him on bridges stood in lanes
laid gifts before him proffer him their oaths
gave him their heirs as pages follow him
even at the heels in golden multitudes
he presently as greatness knows itself
steps me a little higher than his vow
made to my father while his blood was poor
upon the naked shore at ravenspurgh
and now forsooth takes on him to reform
some certain edicts and some strait decrees
that lie too heavy on the commonwealth
cries out upon abuses seems to weep
over his country wrongs and by this face
this seeming brow of justice did he win
the hearts of all that he did angle for
proceeded further cut me off the heads
of all the favourites that the absent king
in deputation left behind him here
when he was personal in the irish war


sir walter blunt

tut i came not to hear this


hotspur

then to the point
in short time after he deposed the king
soon after that deprived him of his life
and in the neck of that task the whole state
to make that worse suffer his kinsman march
who is if every owner were well placed
indeed his king to be engaged in wales
there without ransom to lie forfeited
disgraced me in my happy victories
sought to entrap me by intelligence
rated mine uncle from the council-board
in rage dismiss my father from the court
broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong
and in conclusion drove us to seek out
this head of safety and withal to pry
into his title the which we find
too indirect for long continuance


sir walter blunt

shall i return this answer to the king


hotspur

not so sir walter well withdraw awhile
go to the king and let there be impawn
some surety for a safe return again
and in the morning early shall my uncle
bring him our purposes and so farewell


sir walter blunt

i would you would accept of grace and love


hotspur

and may be so we shall


sir walter blunt

pray god you do

archbishop of york

hie good sir michael bear this sealed brief
with winged haste to the lord marshal
this to my cousin scroop and all the rest
to whom they are directed if you knew
how much they do to import you would make haste


sir michael

my good lord
i guess their tenor


archbishop of york

like enough you do
to-morrow good sir michael is a day
wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
must bide the touch for sir at shrewsbury
as i am truly given to understand
the king with mighty and quick-raised power
meets with lord harry and i fear sir michael
what with the sickness of northumberland
whose power was in the first proportion
and what with owen glendower absence thence
who with them was a rated sinew too
and comes not in oer-ruled by prophecies
i fear the power of percy is too weak
to wage an instant trial with the king


sir michael

why my good lord you need not fear
there is douglas and lord mortimer


archbishop of york

no mortimer is not there


sir michael

but there is mordake vernon lord harry percy
and there is my lord of worcester and a head
of gallant warriors noble gentlemen


archbishop of york

and so there is but yet the king hath drawn
the special head of all the land together
the prince of wales lord john of lancaster
the noble westmoreland and warlike blunt
and moe corrivals and dear men
of estimation and command in arms


sir michael

doubt not my lord they shall be well opposed


archbishop of york

i hope no less yet needful tis to fear
and to prevent the worst sir michael speed
for if lord percy thrive not ere the king
dismiss his power he means to visit us
for he hath heard of our confederacy
and tis but wisdom to make strong against him
therefore make haste i must go write again
to other friends and so farewell sir michael

king henry iv

how bloodily the sun begins to peer
above yon busky hill the day looks pale
at his distemperature


prince henry

the southern wind
doth play the trumpet to his purposes
and by his hollow whistling in the leaves
foretells a tempest and a blustering day


king henry iv

then with the losers let it sympathize
for nothing can seem foul to those that win
the trumpet sounds
enter worcester and vernon
how now my lord of worcester tis not well
that you and i should meet upon such terms
as now we meet you have deceived our trust
and made us doff our easy robes of peace
to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel
this is not well my lord this is not well
what say you to it will you again unknit
this curlish knot of all-abhorred war
and move in that obedient orb again
where you did give a fair and natural light
and be no more an exhaled meteor
a prodigy of fear and a portent
of broached mischief to the unborn times


earl of worcester

hear me my liege
for mine own part i could be well content
to entertain the lag-end of my life
with quiet hours for i do protest
i have not sought the day of this dislike


king henry iv

you have not sought it how comes it then


falstaff

rebellion lay in his way and he found it


prince henry

peace chewet peace


earl of worcester

it pleased your majesty to turn your looks
of favour from myself and all our house
and yet i must remember you my lord
we were the first and dearest of your friends
for you my staff of office did i break
in richard time and posted day and night
to meet you on the way and kiss your hand
when yet you were in place and in account
nothing so strong and fortunate as i
it was myself my brother and his son
that brought you home and boldly did outdare
the dangers of the time you swore to us
and you did swear that oath at doncaster
that you did nothing purpose gainst the state
nor claim no further than your new-falln right
the seat of gaunt dukedom of lancaster
to this we swore our aid but in short space
it rain down fortune showering on your head
and such a flood of greatness fell on you
what with our help what with the absent king
what with the injuries of a wanton time
the seeming sufferances that you had borne
and the contrarious winds that held the king
so long in his unlucky irish wars
that all in england did repute him dead
and from this swarm of fair advantages
you took occasion to be quickly woo
to gripe the general sway into your hand
forget your oath to us at doncaster
and being fed by us you used us so
as that ungentle hull the cuckoo bird
useth the sparrow did oppress our nest
grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
that even our love durst not come near your sight
for fear of swallowing but with nimble wing
we were enforced for safety sake to fly
out of sight and raise this present head
whereby we stand opposed by such means
as you yourself have forged against yourself
by unkind usage dangerous countenance
and violation of all faith and troth
sworn to us in your younger enterprise


king henry iv

these things indeed you have articulate
proclaim at market-crosses read in churches
to face the garment of rebellion
with some fine colour that may please the eye
of fickle changelings and poor discontents
which gape and rub the elbow at the news
of hurlyburly innovation
and never yet did insurrection want
such water-colours to impaint his cause
nor moody beggars starving for a time
of pellmell havoc and confusion


prince henry

in both your armies there is many a soul
shall pay full dearly for this encounter
if once they join in trial tell your nephew
the prince of wales doth join with all the world
in praise of henry percy by my hopes
this present enterprise set off his head
i do not think a braver gentleman
more active-valiant or more valiant-young
more daring or more bold is now alive
to grace this latter age with noble deeds
for my part i may speak it to my shame
i have a truant been to chivalry
and so i hear he doth account me too
yet this before my father majesty 
i am content that he shall take the odds
of his great name and estimation
and will to save the blood on either side
try fortune with him in a single fight


king henry iv

and prince of wales so dare we venture thee
albeit considerations infinite
do make against it no good worcester no
we love our people well even those we love
that are misled upon your cousin part
and will they take the offer of our grace
both he and they and you every man
shall be my friend again and ill be his
so tell your cousin and bring me word
what he will do but if he will not yield
rebuke and dread correction wait on us
and they shall do their office so be gone
we will not now be troubled with reply
we offer fair take it advisedly
exeunt worcester and vernon


prince henry

it will not be accepted on my life
the douglas and the hotspur both together
are confident against the world in arms


king henry iv

hence therefore every leader to his charge
for on their answer will we set on them
and god befriend us as our cause is just

an arm no or take away the grief of a wound no
honour hath no skill in surgery then no what is
honour a word what is in that word honour what
is that honour air a trim reckoning who hath it
he that died o wednesday doth he feel it no
doth he hear it no tis insensible then yea

scene ii the rebel camp

enter worcester and vernon


earl of worcester

o no my nephew must not know sir richard
the liberal and kind offer of the king


vernon

twere best he did


earl of worcester

then are we all undone
it is not possible it cannot be
the king should keep his word in loving us
he will suspect us still and find a time
to punish this offence in other faults
suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes
for treason is but trusted like the fox
who neer so tame so cherish and lock up
will have a wild trick of his ancestors
look how we can or sad or merrily
interpretation will misquote our looks
and we shall feed like oxen at a stall
the better cherish still the nearer death
my nephew trespass may be well forgot
it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood
and an adopted name of privilege
a hair-brain hotspur govern by a spleen
all his offences live upon my head
and on his father we did train him on
and his corruption being taen from us
we as the spring of all shall pay for all
therefore good cousin let not harry know
in any case the offer of the king


vernon

deliver what you will ill say tis so
here comes your cousin

he calls us rebels traitors and will scourge
with haughty arms this hateful name in us
re-enter the earl of douglas


earl of douglas

arm gentlemen to arms for i have thrown
a brave defiance in king henry teeth
and westmoreland that was engaged did bear it
which cannot choose but bring him quickly on


earl of worcester

the prince of wales stepp forth before the king
and nephew challenged you to single fight


hotspur

o would the quarrel lay upon our heads
and that no man might draw short breath today
but i and harry monmouth tell me tell me
how show his tasking seem it in contempt


vernon

no by my soul i never in my life
did hear a challenge urged more modestly
unless a brother should a brother dare
to gentle exercise and proof of arms
he gave you all the duties of a man
trimm up your praises with a princely tongue
spoke to your deservings like a chronicle
making you ever better than his praise
by still dispraising praise valued in you
and which became him like a prince indeed
he made a blushing cital of himself
and chid his truant youth with such a grace
as if he master there a double spirit
of teaching and of learning instantly
there did he pause but let me tell the world
if he outlive the envy of this day
england did never owe so sweet a hope
so much misconstrued in his wantonness


hotspur

cousin i think thou art enamoured
on his follies never did i hear
of any prince so wild a libertine
but be he as he will yet once ere night
i will embrace him with a soldier arm
that he shall shrink under my courtesy
arm arm with speed and fellows soldiers friends
better consider what you have to do
than i that have not well the gift of tongue
can lift your blood up with persuasion

prince henry

hotspur

o harry thou hast robb me of my youth
i better brook the loss of brittle life

but thought the slave of life and life time fool
and time that takes survey of all the world
must have a stop o i could prophesy
but that the earthy and cold hand of death
lies on my tongue no percy thou art dust
and food for 
dies


prince henry

for worms brave percy fare thee well great heart
ill-weaved ambition how much art thou shrunk
when that this body did contain a spirit
a kingdom for it was too small a bound
but now two paces of the vilest earth
is room enough this earth that bears thee dead
bears not alive so stout a gentleman
if thou wert sensible of courtesy
i should not make so dear a show of zeal
but let my favours hide thy mangled face
and even in thy behalf ill thank myself
for doing these fair rites of tenderness
adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven
thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave
but not remember in thy epitaph
he spieth falstaff on the ground
what old acquaintance could not all this flesh
keep in a little life poor jack farewell
i could have better spared a better man
o i should have a heavy miss of thee
if i were much in love with vanity
death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day
though many dearer in this bloody fray
embowell will i see thee by and by
till then in blood by noble percy lie

rising up  embowelled if thou embowel me to-day
ill give you leave to powder me and eat me too
to-morrow bloodtwas time to counterfeit or

counterfeit i lie i am no counterfeit to die
is to be a counterfeit for he is but the
counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man
but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby
liveth is to be no counterfeit but the true and
perfect image of life indeed the better part of
valour is discretion in the which better part i
have saved my lifezounds i am afraid of this
gunpowder percy though he be dead how if he
should counterfeit too and rise by my faith i am
afraid he would prove the better counterfeit
therefore ill make him sure yea and ill swear i
killed him why may not he rise as well as i
nothing confutes me but eyes and nobody sees me

falstaff

throwing the body down
if your father will do me any honour so if not let
him kill the next percy himself i look to be either
earl or duke i can assure you


prince henry

why percy i killed myself and saw thee dead


falstaff

didst thou lord lord how this world is given to
lying i grant you i was down and out of breath
and so was he but we rose both at an instant and
fought a long hour by shrewsbury clock if i may be
believed so if not let them that should reward
valour bear the sin upon their own heads ill take
it upon my death i gave him this wound in the
thigh if the man were alive and would deny it
zounds i would make him eat a piece of my sword


lancaster

comets importing change of times and states

and with them scourge the bad revolting stars
that have consented unto henry death
king henry the fifth too famous to live long
england neer lost a king of so much worth


gloucester

england neer had a king until his time
virtue he had deserving to command
his brandish sword did blind men with his beams
his arms spread wider than a dragon wings
his sparking eyes replete with wrathful fire
more dazzled and drove back his enemies
than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces
what should i say his deeds exceed all speech
he neer lift up his hand but conquered


exeter

we mourn in black why mourn we not in blood
henry is dead and never shall revive
upon a wooden coffin we attend
and death dishonourable victory
we with our stately presence glorify
like captives bound to a triumphant car
what shall we curse the planets of mishap
that plotted thus our glory overthrow
or shall we think the subtle-witted french
conjurers and sorcerers that afraid of him
by magic verses have contrived his end
bishop


of winchester

he was a king bless of the king of kings
unto the french the dreadful judgement-day
so dreadful will not be as was his sight
the battles of the lord of hosts he fought
the church prayers made him so prosperous

his thread of life had not so soon decay
none do you like but an effeminate prince
whom like a school-boy you may over-awe

messenger

no treachery but want of men and money
amongst the soldiers this is muttered
that here you maintain several factions
and whilst a field should be dispatch and fought

my gracious lords to add to your laments
wherewith you now bedew king henry hearse
i must inform you of a dismal fight
betwixt the stout lord talbot and the french
bishop


of winchester

what wherein talbot overcame ist so


messenger

o no wherein lord talbot was oerthrown
the circumstance ill tell you more at large
the tenth of august last this dreadful lord
retiring from the siege of orleans
having full scarce six thousand in his troop
by three and twenty thousand of the french
was round encompassed and set upon
no leisure had he to enrank his men
he wanted pikes to set before his archers
instead whereof sharp stakes pluck out of hedges
they pitched in the ground confusedly
to keep the horsemen off from breaking in
more than three hours the fight continued
where valiant talbot above human thought
enacted wonders with his sword and lance
hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him
here there and every where enraged he flew
the french exclaim the devil was in arms
all the whole army stood agazed on him
his soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
a talbot a talbot cried out amain
and rush into the bowels of the battle
here had the conquest fully been seal up
if sir john fastolfe had not play the coward
he being in the vaward placed behind
with purpose to relieve and follow them
cowardly fled not having struck one stroke
hence grew the general wreck and massacre
enclosed were they with their enemies
a base walloon to win the dauphin grace
thrust talbot with a spear into the back
whom all france with their chief assembled strength
durst not presume to look once in the face


bedford

is talbot slain then i will slay myself
for living idly here in pomp and ease
whilst such a worthy leader wanting aid
unto his dastard foemen is betray


messenger

o no he lives but is took prisoner
and lord scales with him and lord hungerford
most of the rest slaughter or took likewise


bedford

his ransom there is none but i shall pay

four of their lords ill change for one of ours
farewell my masters to my task will i
bonfires in france forthwith i am to make
to keep our great saint george feast withal
ten thousand soldiers with me i will take
whose bloody deeds shall make all europe quake


messenger

so you had need for orleans is besieged
the english army is grown weak and faint
the earl of salisbury craveth supply
and hardly keeps his men from mutiny
since they so few watch such a multitude

faintly besiege us one hour in a month

either they must be dieted like mules
and have their provender tied to their mouths

remaineth none but mad-brain salisbury
and he may well in fretting spend his gall

the other lords like lions wanting food
do rush upon us as their hungry prey


alencon

froissart a countryman of ours records
england all olivers and rowlands bred
during the time edward the third did reign
more truly now may this be verified
for none but samsons and goliases
it sendeth forth to skirmish one to ten
lean raw-boned rascals who would eer suppose
they had such courage and audacity


charles

let leave this town for they are hare-brain slaves
and hunger will enforce them to be more eager
of old i know them rather with their teeth
the walls theyll tear down than forsake the siege


reignier

i think by some odd gimmors or device
their arms are set like clocks stiff to strike on
else neer could they hold out so as they do
by my consent well even let them alone

be not dismay for succor is at hand
a holy maid hither with me i bring
which by a vision sent to her from heaven
ordained is to raise this tedious siege
and drive the english forth the bounds of france
the spirit of deep prophecy she hath
exceeding the nine sibyls of old rome
what past and what to come she can descry
speak shall i call her in believe my words
for they are certain and unfallible

question her proudly let thy looks be stern
by this means shall we sound what skill she hath
re-enter the bastard of orleans with joan la pucelle

be not amazed there nothing hid from me
in private will i talk with thee apart
stand back you lords and give us leave awhile


reignier

she takes upon her bravely at first dash


joan la pucelle

dauphin i am by birth a shepherd daughter
my wit untrain in any kind of art
heaven and our lady gracious hath it pleased
to shine on my contemptible estate
lo whilst i waited on my tender lambs
and to sun parching heat display my cheeks
god mother deigned to appear to me
and in a vision full of majesty
will me to leave my base vocation
and free my country from calamity
her aid she promised and assured success
in complete glory she reveal herself
and whereas i was black and swart before
with those clear rays which she infused on me
that beauty am i bless with which you see
ask me what question thou canst possible
and i will answer unpremeditated
my courage try by combat if thou darest
and thou shalt find that i exceed my sex
resolve on this thou shalt be fortunate
if thou receive me for thy warlike mate


charles

thou hast astonish me with thy high terms
only this proof ill of thy valour make
in single combat thou shalt buckle with me
and if thou vanquishest thy words are true
otherwise i renounce all confidence


joan la pucelle

i am prepared here is my keen-edged sword
deck with five flower-de-luces on each side
the which at touraine in saint katharine
churchyard
out of a great deal of old iron i chose forth

here they fight and joan la pucelle overcomes


charles

stay stay thy hands thou art an amazon
and fightest with the sword of deborah


joan la pucelle

christ mother helps me else i were too weak


charles

whoeer helps thee tis thou that must help me
impatiently i burn with thy desire
my heart and hands thou hast at once subdued
excellent pucelle if thy name be so
let me thy servant and not sovereign be
tis the french dauphin sueth to thee thus


joan la pucelle

i must not yield to any rites of love
for my profession sacred from above
when i have chased all thy foes from hence
then will i think upon a recompense


charles

meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall


reignier

my lord methinks is very long in talk


alencon

doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock
else neer could he so long protract his speech


reignier

shall we disturb him since he keeps no mean


alencon

he may mean more than we poor men do know
these women are shrewd tempters with their tongues


reignier

my lord where are you what devise you on
shall we give over orleans or no


joan la pucelle

why no i say distrustful recreants
fight till the last gasp i will be your guard


charles

joan la pucelle

assign am i to be the english scourge
this night the siege assuredly ill raise
expect saint martin summer halcyon days
since i have entered into these wars
glory is like a circle in the water
which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
till by broad spreading it disperse to nought
with henry death the english circle ends
dispersed are the glories it included
now am i like that proud insulting ship
which caesar and his fortune bare at once

nor yet saint philip daughters were like thee
bright star of venus falln down on the earth

in yonder tower to overpeer the city

or by what means got thou to be released
discourse i prithee on this turret top


talbot

the duke of bedford had a prisoner
call the brave lord ponton de santrailles
for him was i exchanged and ransomed
but with a baser man of arms by far
once in contempt they would have barter me
which i disdaining scorn and craved death
rather than i would be so vile esteem
in fine redeem i was as i desired
but o the treacherous fastolfe wounds my heart
whom with my bare fists i would execute
if i now had him brought into my power


salisbury

yet tell thou not how thou wert entertain


talbot

with scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts
in open market-place produced they me
to be a public spectacle to all
here said they is the terror of the french
the scarecrow that affrights our children so
then broke i from the officers that led me
and with my nails digg stones out of the ground
to hurl at the beholders of my shame
my grisly countenance made others fly
none durst come near for fear of sudden death
in iron walls they deem me not secure
so great fear of my name mongst them was spread
that they supposed i could rend bars of steel
and spurn in pieces posts of adamant
wherefore a guard of chosen shot i had
that walked about me every minute-while
and if i did but stir out of my bed
ready they were to shoot me to the heart
enter the boy with a linstock


salisbury

i grieve to hear what torments you endured
but we will be revenged sufficiently
now it is supper-time in orleans
here through this grate i count each one
and view the frenchmen how they fortify
let us look in the sight will much delight thee
sir thomas gargrave and sir william glansdale
let me have your express opinions
where is best place to make our battery next


gargrave

i think at the north gate for there stand lords


glansdale

and i here at the bulwark of the bridge


talbot

for aught i see this city must be famish
or with light skirmishes enfeebled
here they shoot salisbury and gargrave fall


salisbury

o lord have mercy on us wretched sinners


gargrave

o lord have mercy on me woful man


talbot

what chance is this that suddenly hath cross us
speak salisbury at least if thou canst speak
how farest thou mirror of all martial men
one of thy eyes and thy cheek side struck off
accursed tower accursed fatal hand
that hath contrived this woful tragedy
in thirteen battles salisbury oercame
henry the fifth he first train to the wars
whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up
his sword did neer leave striking in the field
yet livest thou salisbury though thy speech doth fail
one eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace
the sun with one eye vieweth all the world
heaven be thou gracious to none alive
if salisbury wants mercy at thy hands
bear hence his body i will help to bury it
sir thomas gargrave hast thou any life
speak unto talbot nay look up to him
salisbury cheer thy spirit with this comfort
thou shalt not die whiles 
he beckons with his hand and smiles on me
as who should say when i am dead and gone
remember to avenge me on the french
plantagenet i will and like thee nero
play on the lute beholding the towns burn
wretched shall france be only in my name

what stir is this what tumult in the heavens
whence cometh this alarum and the noise

exit


talbot

my thoughts are whirled like a potter wheel
i know not where i am nor what i do
a witch by fear not force like hannibal
drives back our troops and conquers as she lists
so bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
are from their hives and houses driven away
they call us for our fierceness english dogs
now like to whelps we crying run away
a short alarum
hark countrymen either renew the fight
or tear the lions out of england coat
renounce your soil give sheep in lions stead
sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf
or horse or oxen from the leopard
as you fly from your oft-subdued slaves
alarum here another skirmish
it will not be retire into your trenches
you all consented unto salisbury death
for none would strike a stroke in his revenge

talbot

lord regent and redoubted burgundy
by whose approach the regions of artois
wallon and picardy are friends to us
this happy night the frenchmen are secure
having all day caroused and banqueted
embrace we then this opportunity
as fitting best to quittance their deceit
contrived by art and baleful sorcery


bedford

coward of france how much he wrongs his fame
despairing of his own arm fortitude
to join with witches and the help of hell


burgundy

traitors have never other company
but what that pucelle whom they term so pure


talbot

bedford

a maid and be so martial


burgundy

pray god she prove not masculine ere long
if underneath the standard of the french
she carry armour as she hath begun


talbot

well let them practise and converse with spirits
god is our fortress in whose conquering name
let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks


bedford

ascend brave talbot we will follow thee


talbot

that we do make our entrance several ways
that if it chance the one of us do fail
the other yet may rise against their force


bedford

bastard of orleans

tut holy joan was his defensive guard
enter charles and joan la pucelle


charles

is this thy cunning thou deceitful dame
didst thou at first to flatter us withal
make us partakers of a little gain
that now our loss might be ten times so much


joan la pucelle

wherefore is charles impatient with his friend
at all times will you have my power alike
sleeping or waking must i still prevail
or will you blame and lay the fault on me
improvident soldiers had your watch been good
this sudden mischief never could have falln


charles

duke of alencon this was your default
that being captain of the watch to-night
did look no better to that weighty charge


alencon

had all your quarters been as safely kept
as that whereof i had the government
we had not been thus shamefully surprised


bastard of orleans

mine was secure


reignier

and so was mine my lord


charles

and for myself most part of all this night
within her quarter and mine own precinct
i was employ in passing to and fro
about relieving of the sentinels
then how or which way should they first break in


joan la pucelle

question my lords no further of the case
how or which way tis sure they found some place
but weakly guarded where the breach was made
and now there rests no other shift but this
to gather our soldiers scatter and dispersed
and lay new platforms to endamage them
alarum enter an english soldier crying a  talbot a talbot they fly leaving their clothes behind


soldier

ill be so bold to take what they have left
the cry of talbot serves me for a sword
for i have loaden me with many spoils
using no other weapon but his name

retreat sounded


talbot

bring forth the body of old salisbury
and here advance it in the market-place
the middle centre of this cursed town
now have i paid my vow unto his soul
for every drop of blood was drawn from him
there hath at least five frenchmen died tonight
and that hereafter ages may behold
what ruin happen in revenge of him
within their chiefest temple ill erect
a tomb wherein his corpse shall be interr
upon the which that every one may read
shall be engraved the sack of orleans
the treacherous manner of his mournful death
and what a terror he had been to france
but lords in all our bloody massacre
i muse we met not with the dauphin grace
his new-come champion virtuous joan of arc
nor any of his false confederates


bedford

tis thought lord talbot when the fight began
roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds
they did amongst the troops of armed men
leap oer the walls for refuge in the field


burgundy

myself as far as i could well discern
for smoke and dusky vapours of the night
am sure i scared the dauphin and his trull
when arm in arm they both came swiftly running
like to a pair of loving turtle-doves
that could not live asunder day or night
after that things are set in order here
well follow them with all the power we have
enter a messenger


messenger

call ye the warlike talbot for his acts

messenger

with modesty admiring thy renown
by me entreats great lord thou wouldst vouchsafe
to visit her poor castle where she lies
that she may boast she hath beheld the man
whose glory fills the world with loud report


burgundy

is it even so nay then i see our wars
will turn unto a peaceful comic sport
when ladies crave to be encounter with
you may not my lord despise her gentle suit


talbot

neer trust me then for when a world of men
could not prevail with all their oratory
yet hath a woman kindness over-ruled
and therefore tell her i return great thanks
and in submission will attend on her
will not your honours bear me company


bedford

no truly it is more than manners will
and i have heard it said unbidden guests
are often welcomest when they are gone


talbot

i mean to prove this lady courtesy
come hither captain

countess


of auvergne

the plot is laid if all things fall out right
i shall as famous be by this exploit
as scythian tomyris by cyrus death
great is the rumor of this dreadful knight
and his achievements of no less account
fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears
to give their censure of these rare reports
enter messenger and talbot


messenger

madam
according as your ladyship desired
by message craved so is lord talbot come
countess


of auvergne

and he is welcome what is this the man


messenger

madam it is
countess


of auvergne

is this the scourge of france
is this the talbot so much fear abroad
that with his name the mothers still their babes
i see report is fabulous and false
i thought i should have seen some hercules
a second hector for his grim aspect
and large proportion of his strong-knit limbs
alas this is a child a silly dwarf
it cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
should strike such terror to his enemies


talbot

madam i have been bold to trouble you
but since your ladyship is not at leisure
ill sort some other time to visit you
countess


of auvergne

what means he now go ask him whither he goes


messenger

stay my lord talbot for my lady craves
to know the cause of your abrupt departure

i go to certify her talbot here
re-enter porter with keys

of auvergne

if thou be he then art thou prisoner


talbot

prisoner to whom
countess


of auvergne

to me blood-thirsty lord
and for that cause i trained thee to my house
long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me
for in my gallery thy picture hangs
but now the substance shall endure the like
and i will chain these legs and arms of thine
that hast by tyranny these many years
wasted our country slain our citizens
and sent our sons and husbands captivate


talbot

ha ha ha
countess


of auvergne

laughest thou wretch thy mirth shall turn to moan


talbot

i laugh to see your ladyship so fond
to think that you have aught but talbot shadow
whereon to practise your severity
countess


of auvergne

why art not thou the man


talbot

i am indeed
countess


of auvergne

then have i substance too


talbot

no no i am but shadow of myself
you are deceived my substance is not here
for what you see is but the smallest part
and least proportion of humanity
i tell you madam were the whole frame here
it is of such a spacious lofty pitch
your roof were not sufficient to containt
countess


of auvergne

this is a riddling merchant for the nonce
he will be here and yet he is not here
how can these contrarieties agree


talbot

that will i show you presently
winds his horn drums strike up a peal of ordnance enter soldiers
how say you madam are you now persuaded
that talbot is but shadow of himself
these are his substance sinews arms and strength
with which he yoketh your rebellious necks
razeth your cities and subverts your towns
and in a moment makes them desolate
countess


of auvergne

victorious talbot pardon my abuse
i find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
and more than may be gather by thy shape
let my presumption not provoke thy wrath
for i am sorry that with reverence
i did not entertain thee as thou art


talbot

be not dismay fair lady nor misconstrue
the mind of talbot as you did mistake
the outward composition of his body
what you have done hath not offended me
nor other satisfaction do i crave
but only with your patience that we may
taste of your wine and see what cates you have
for soldiers stomachs always serve them well
countess


of auvergne

to feast so great a warrior in my house

scene iv london the temple-garden

richard


plantagenet

great lords and gentlemen what means this silence
dare no man answer in a case of truth


suffolk

within the temple-hall we were too loud
the garden here is more convenient
richard


plantagenet

then say at once if i maintain the truth
or else was wrangling somerset in the error


suffolk

faith i have been a truant in the law
and never yet could frame my will to it
and therefore frame the law unto my will


somerset

judge you my lord of warwick then between us


warwick

between two hawks which flies the higher pitch
between two dogs which hath the deeper mouth
between two blades which bears the better temper
between two horses which doth bear him best
between two girls which hath the merriest eye
i have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement
but in these nice sharp quillets of the law
good faith i am no wiser than a daw
richard


plantagenet

tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance
the truth appears so naked on my side
that any purblind eye may find it out


somerset

and on my side it is so well apparell
so clear so shining and so evident
that it will glimmer through a blind man eye
richard


plantagenet

since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak
in dumb significants proclaim your thoughts
let him that is a true-born gentleman
and stands upon the honour of his birth
if he suppose that i have pleaded truth
from off this brier pluck a white rose with me


somerset

let him that is no coward nor no flatterer
but dare maintain the party of the truth
pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me


warwick

i love no colours and without all colour
of base insinuating flattery
i pluck this white rose with plantagenet


suffolk

i pluck this red rose with young somerset
and say withal i think he held the right


vernon

stay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more
till you conclude that he upon whose side
the fewest roses are cropp from the tree
shall yield the other in the right opinion


somerset

good master vernon it is well objected
if i have fewest i subscribe in silence
richard


plantagenet

and i


vernon

then for the truth and plainness of the case
i pluck this pale and maiden blossom here
giving my verdict on the white rose side


somerset

prick not your finger as you pluck it off
lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
and fall on my side so against your will


vernon

if i my lord for my opinion bleed
opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
and keep me on the side where still i am


somerset

well well come on who else


lawyer

unless my study and my books be false
the argument you held was wrong in you
to somerset
in sign whereof i pluck a white rose too
richard


plantagenet

now somerset where is your argument


somerset

here in my scabbard meditating that
shall dye your white rose in a bloody red
richard


plantagenet

meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses
for pale they look with fear as witnessing
the truth on our side


somerset

no plantagenet
tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses
and yet thy tongue will not confess thy error
richard


plantagenet

hath not thy rose a canker somerset


somerset

hath not thy rose a thorn plantagenet
richard


plantagenet

ay sharp and piercing to maintain his truth
whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood


somerset

well ill find friends to wear my bleeding roses
that shall maintain what i have said is true
where false plantagenet dare not be seen
richard


plantagenet

now by this maiden blossom in my hand
i scorn thee and thy fashion peevish boy


suffolk

turn not thy scorns this way plantagenet
richard


plantagenet

proud pole i will and scorn both him and thee


suffolk

ill turn my part thereof into thy throat


somerset

away away good william de la pole
we grace the yeoman by conversing with him


warwick

now by god will thou wrong him somerset
his grandfather was lionel duke of clarence
third son to the third edward king of england
spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root
richard


plantagenet

he bears him on the place privilege
or durst not for his craven heart say thus


somerset

by him that made me ill maintain my words
on any plot of ground in christendom
was not thy father richard earl of cambridge
for treason executed in our late king days
and by his treason stand not thou attainted
corrupted and exempt from ancient gentry
his trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood
and till thou be restored thou art a yeoman
richard


plantagenet

my father was attached not attainted
condemn to die for treason but no traitor
and that ill prove on better men than somerset
were growing time once ripen to my will
for your partaker pole and you yourself
ill note you in my book of memory
to scourge you for this apprehension
look to it well and say you are well warn


somerset

ah thou shalt find us ready for thee still
and know us by these colours for thy foes
for these my friends in spite of thee shall wear
richard


plantagenet

and by my soul this pale and angry rose
as cognizance of my blood-drinking hate
will i for ever and my faction wear
until it wither with me to my grave
or flourish to the height of my degree


suffolk

go forward and be choked with thy ambition
and so farewell until i meet thee next
exit


somerset

have with thee pole farewell ambitious richard
exit
richard


plantagenet

how i am braved and must perforce endure it


warwick

this blot that they object against your house
shall be wiped out in the next parliament
call for the truce of winchester and gloucester
and if thou be not then created york
i will not live to be accounted warwick
meantime in signal of my love to thee
against proud somerset and william pole
will i upon thy party wear this rose
and here i prophesy this brawl to-day
grown to this faction in the temple-garden
shall send between the red rose and the white
a thousand souls to death and deadly night
richard


plantagenet

good master vernon i am bound to you
that you on my behalf would pluck a flower


vernon

in your behalf still will i wear the same


lawyer

and so will i

this quarrel will drink blood another day

scene v the tower of london

enter mortimer brought in a chair and gaolers


mortimer

kind keepers of my weak decaying age
let dying mortimer here rest himself
even like a man new haled from the rack
so fare my limbs with long imprisonment
and these grey locks the pursuivants of death
nestor-like aged in an age of care
argue the end of edmund mortimer
these eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent
wax dim as drawing to their exigent
weak shoulders overborne with burthening grief
and pithless arms like to a wither vine
that droops his sapless branches to the ground
yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb
unable to support this lump of clay
swift-winged with desire to get a grave
as witting i no other comfort have
but tell me keeper will my nephew come


first gaoler

richard plantagenet my lord will come
we sent unto the temple unto his chamber
and answer was return that he will come


mortimer

enough my soul shall then be satisfied
poor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine
since henry monmouth first began to reign
before whose glory i was great in arms
this loathsome sequestration have i had
and even since then hath richard been obscured
deprived of honour and inheritance
but now the arbitrator of despairs
just death kind umpire of men miseries
with sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence
i would his troubles likewise were expired
that so he might recover what was lost
enter richard plantagenet


first gaoler

my lord your loving nephew now is come


mortimer

richard plantagenet my friend is he come
richard


plantagenet

ay noble uncle thus ignobly used
your nephew late despised richard comes


mortimer

direct mine arms i may embrace his neck
and in his bosom spend my latter gasp
o tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks
that i may kindly give one fainting kiss
and now declare sweet stem from york great stock
why didst thou say of late thou wert despised
richard


plantagenet

first lean thine aged back against mine arm
and in that ease ill tell thee my disease
this day in argument upon a case
some words there grew twixt somerset and me
among which terms he used his lavish tongue
and did upbraid me with my father death
which obloquy set bars before my tongue
else with the like i had requited him
therefore good uncle for my father sake
in honour of a true plantagenet
and for alliance sake declare the cause
my father earl of cambridge lost his head


mortimer

that cause fair nephew that imprison me
and hath detain me all my flowering youth
within a loathsome dungeon there to pine
was cursed instrument of his decease
richard


plantagenet

discover more at large what cause that was
for i am ignorant and cannot guess


mortimer

i will if that my fading breath permit
and death approach not ere my tale be done
henry the fourth grandfather to this king
deposed his nephew richard edward son
the first-begotten and the lawful heir
of edward king the third of that descent
during whose reign the percies of the north
finding his usurpation most unjust
endeavor my advancement to the throne
the reason moved these warlike lords to this
was for that young king richard thus removed
leaving no heir begotten of his body 
i was the next by birth and parentage
for by my mother i derived am
from lionel duke of clarence the third son
to king edward the third whereas he
from john of gaunt doth bring his pedigree
being but fourth of that heroic line
but mark as in this haughty attempt
they laboured to plant the rightful heir
i lost my liberty and they their lives
long after this when henry the fifth
succeeding his father bolingbroke did reign
thy father earl of cambridge then derived
from famous edmund langley duke of york
marrying my sister that thy mother was
again in pity of my hard distress
levied an army weening to redeem
and have install me in the diadem
but as the rest so fell that noble earl
and was beheaded thus the mortimers
in whom the tide rested were suppress
richard


plantagenet

of which my lord your honour is the last


mortimer

true and thou seest that i no issue have
and that my fainting words do warrant death
thou art my heir the rest i wish thee gather
but yet be wary in thy studious care
richard


plantagenet

thy grave admonishments prevail with me
but yet methinks my father execution
was nothing less than bloody tyranny


mortimer

with silence nephew be thou politic
strong-fixed is the house of lancaster
and like a mountain not to be removed
but now thy uncle is removing hence
as princes do their courts when they are cloy
with long continuance in a settled place
richard


plantagenet

o uncle would some part of my young years
might but redeem the passage of your age


mortimer

thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer doth
which giveth many wounds when one will kill
mourn not except thou sorrow for my good
only give order for my funeral
and so farewell and fair be all thy hopes
and prosperous be thy life in peace and war
dies
richard


plantagenet

and peace no war befall thy parting soul
in prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage
and like a hermit overpass thy days
well i will lock his counsel in my breast
and what i do imagine let that rest
keepers convey him hence and i myself
will see his burial better than his life
exeunt gaolers bearing out the body of mortimer
here dies the dusky torch of mortimer
choked with ambition of the meaner sort
and for those wrongs those bitter injuries
which somerset hath offer to my house
i doubt not but with honour to redress
and therefore haste i to the parliament
either to be restored to my blood
or make my ill the advantage of my good
exit

act iii
scene i london the parliament-house

flourish enter king henry vi exeter gloucester  warwick somerset and suffolk the bishop of  winchester richard plantagenet and others  gloucester offers to put up a bill bishop of winchester snatches it and tears it


bishop


of winchester

comest thou with deep premeditated lines
with written pamphlets studiously devised
humphrey of gloucester if thou canst accuse
or aught intend to lay unto my charge
do it without invention suddenly
as i with sudden and extemporal speech
purpose to answer what thou canst object


gloucester

presumptuous priest this place commands my patience
or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour me
think not although in writing i preferr
the manner of thy vile outrageous crimes
that therefore i have forged or am not able
verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen
no prelate such is thy audacious wickedness
thy lewd pestiferous and dissentious pranks
as very infants prattle of thy pride
thou art a most pernicious usurer
forward by nature enemy to peace
lascivious wanton more than well beseems
a man of thy profession and degree
and for thy treachery what more manifest
in that thou laid a trap to take my life
as well at london bridge as at the tower
beside i fear me if thy thoughts were sifted
the king thy sovereign is not quite exempt
from envious malice of thy swelling heart
bishop


of winchester

gloucester i do defy thee lords vouchsafe
to give me hearing what i shall reply
if i were covetous ambitious or perverse
as he will have me how am i so poor
or how haps it i seek not to advance
or raise myself but keep my wonted calling
and for dissension who preferreth peace
more than i do except i be provoked
no my good lords it is not that offends
it is not that that hath incensed the duke
it is because no one should sway but he
no one but he should be about the king
and that engenders thunder in his breast
and makes him roar these accusations forth
but he shall know i am as good 


gloucester

as good
thou bastard of my grandfather
bishop


of winchester

ay lordly sir for what are you i pray
but one imperious in another throne


gloucester

am i not protector saucy priest
bishop


of winchester

and am not i a prelate of the church


gloucester

yes as an outlaw in a castle keeps
and useth it to patronage his theft
bishop


of winchester

gloucester

touching thy spiritual function not thy life
bishop


of winchester

rome shall remedy this


warwick

roam thither then


somerset

my lord it were your duty to forbear


warwick

ay see the bishop be not overborne


somerset

methinks my lord should be religious
and know the office that belongs to such


warwick

methinks his lordship should be humbler
it fitteth not a prelate so to plead


somerset

yes when his holy state is touch so near


warwick

state holy or unhallow what of that
is not his grace protector to the king
richard


plantagenet

aside  plantagenet i see must hold his tongue
lest it be said peak sirrah when you should
must your bold verdict enter talk with lords
else would i have a fling at winchester


king henry vi

uncles of gloucester and of winchester
the special watchmen of our english weal
i would prevail if prayers might prevail
to join your hearts in love and amity
o what a scandal is it to our crown
that two such noble peers as ye should jar
believe me lords my tender years can tell
civil dissension is a viperous worm
that gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth
a noise within own with the tawny-coats
what tumult this


warwick

an uproar i dare warrant
begun through malice of the bishop men
a noise again ones stones enter mayor


mayor

o my good lords and virtuous henry
pity the city of london pity us
the bishop and the duke of gloucester men
forbidden late to carry any weapon
have fill their pockets full of pebble stones
and banding themselves in contrary parts
do pelt so fast at one another pate
that many have their giddy brains knock out
our windows are broke down in every street
and we for fear compell to shut our shops
enter serving-men in skirmish with bloody pates


king henry vi

we charge you on allegiance to ourself
to hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace
pray uncle gloucester mitigate this strife
first serving-mannay if we be forbidden stones
well fall to it with our teeth
second serving-mando what ye dare we are as resolute
skirmish again


gloucester

you of my household leave this peevish broil
and set this unaccustom fight aside
third serving-manmy lord we know your grace to be a man
just and upright and for your royal birth
inferior to none but to his majesty
and ere that we will suffer such a prince
so kind a father of the commonweal
to be disgraced by an inkhorn mate
we and our wives and children all will fight
and have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes
first serving-manay and the very parings of our nails
shall pitch a field when we are dead
begin again


gloucester

stay stay i say
and if you love me as you say you do
let me persuade you to forbear awhile


king henry vi

o how this discord doth afflict my soul
can you my lord of winchester behold
my sighs and tears and will not once relent
who should be pitiful if you be not
or who should study to prefer a peace
if holy churchmen take delight in broils


warwick

yield my lord protector yield winchester
except you mean with obstinate repulse
to slay your sovereign and destroy the realm
you see what mischief and what murder too
hath been enacted through your enmity
then be at peace except ye thirst for blood
bishop


of winchester

he shall submit or i will never yield


gloucester

compassion on the king commands me stoop
or i would see his heart out ere the priest
should ever get that privilege of me


warwick

behold my lord of winchester the duke
hath banish moody discontented fury
as by his smoothed brows it doth appear
why look you still so stern and tragical


gloucester

here winchester i offer thee my hand


king henry vi

fie uncle beaufort i have heard you preach
that malice was a great and grievous sin
and will not you maintain the thing you teach
but prove a chief offender in the same


warwick

sweet king the bishop hath a kindly gird
for shame my lord of winchester relent
what shall a child instruct you what to do
bishop


of winchester

well duke of gloucester i will yield to thee
love for thy love and hand for hand i give


gloucester

aside  ay but i fear me with a hollow heart 
see here my friends and loving countrymen
this token serveth for a flag of truce
betwixt ourselves and all our followers
so help me god as i dissemble not
bishop


of winchester

aside  so help me god as i intend it not


king henry vi

o loving uncle kind duke of gloucester
how joyful am i made by this contract
away my masters trouble us no more
but join in friendship as your lords have done
first serving-mancontent ill to the surgeon
second serving-manand so will i
third serving-manand i will see what physic the tavern affords
exeunt serving-men mayor   c


warwick

accept this scroll most gracious sovereign
which in the right of richard plantagenet
we do exhibit to your majesty


gloucester

well urged my lord of warwick or sweet prince
and if your grace mark every circumstance
you have great reason to do richard right
especially for those occasions
at eltham place i told your majesty


king henry vi

and those occasions uncle were of force
therefore my loving lords our pleasure is
that richard be restored to his blood


warwick

let richard be restored to his blood
so shall his father wrongs be recompensed
bishop


of winchester

as will the rest so willeth winchester


king henry vi

if richard will be true not that alone
but all the whole inheritance i give
that doth belong unto the house of york
from whence you spring by lineal descent
richard


plantagenet

thy humble servant vows obedience
and humble service till the point of death


king henry vi

stoop then and set your knee against my foot
and in reguerdon of that duty done
i gird thee with the valiant sword of york
rise richard like a true plantagenet
and rise created princely duke of york
richard


plantagenet

and so thrive richard as thy foes may fall
and as my duty springs so perish they
that grudge one thought against your majesty


all

welcome high prince the mighty duke of york


somerset

aside  perish base prince ignoble duke of york


gloucester

now will it best avail your majesty
to cross the seas and to be crown in france
the presence of a king engenders love
amongst his subjects and his loyal friends
as it disanimates his enemies


king henry vi

when gloucester says the word king henry goes
for friendly counsel cuts off many foes


gloucester

your ships already are in readiness
sennet flourish exeunt all but exeter


exeter

ay we may march in england or in france
not seeing what is likely to ensue
this late dissension grown betwixt the peers
burns under feigned ashes of forged love
and will at last break out into a flame
as fester members rot but by degree
till bones and flesh and sinews fall away
so will this base and envious discord breed
and now i fear that fatal prophecy
which in the time of henry named the fifth
was in the mouth of every sucking babe
that henry born at monmouth should win all
and henry born at windsor lose all
which is so plain that exeter doth wish
his days may finish ere that hapless time

joan la pucelle

if talbot do but thunder rain will follow
the english whisper together in council
god speed the parliament who shall be the speaker


talbot

to try if that our own be ours or no


talbot

but unto thee alencon and the rest
will ye like soldiers come and fight it out


alencon

talbot

like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls
and dare not take up arms like gentlemen


joan la pucelle

for talbot means no goodness by his looks
god be wi you my lord we came but to tell you
that we are here
exeunt from the walls


talbot

and there will we be too ere it be long
or else reproach be talbot greatest fame
vow burgundy by honour of thy house
prick on by public wrongs sustain in france
either to get the town again or die
and i as sure as english henry lives
and as his father here was conqueror
as sure as in this late-betrayed town
great coeur-de-lion heart was buried
so sure i swear to get the town or die


burgundy

my vows are equal partners with thy vows


talbot

but ere we go regard this dying prince
the valiant duke of bedford come my lord
we will bestow you in some better place
fitter for sickness and for crazy age


bedford

lord talbot do not so dishonour me
here will i sit before the walls of rouen
and will be partner of your weal or woe


burgundy

courageous bedford let us now persuade you


bedford

not to be gone from hence for once i read
that stout pendragon in his litter sick
came to the field and vanquished his foes
methinks i should revive the soldiers hearts
because i ever found them as myself


talbot

undaunted spirit in a dying breast
then be it so heavens keep old bedford safe
and now no more ado brave burgundy
but gather we our forces out of hand
and set upon our boasting enemy

this is a double honour burgundy
yet heavens have glory for this victory


burgundy

warlike and martial talbot burgundy

talbot

thanks gentle duke but where is pucelle now
i think her old familiar is asleep
now where the bastard braves and charles his gleeks
what all amort rouen hangs her head for grief
that such a valiant company are fled
now will we take some order in the town
placing therein some expert officers
and then depart to paris to the king
for there young henry with his nobles lie


burgundy

what wills lord talbot pleaseth burgundy


talbot

but yet before we go let not forget
the noble duke of bedford late deceased
but see his exequies fulfill in rouen
a braver soldier never couched lance
a gentler heart did never sway in court
but kings and mightiest potentates must die
for that the end of human misery
exeunt

scene iii the plains near rouen

enter charles the bastard of orleans alencon joan la pucelle and forces


joan la pucelle

dismay not princes at this accident
nor grieve that rouen is so recovered
care is no cure but rather corrosive
for things that are not to be remedied
let frantic talbot triumph for a while
and like a peacock sweep along his tail
well pull his plumes and take away his train
if dauphin and the rest will be but ruled


charles

we have been guided by thee hitherto
and of thy cunning had no diffidence
one sudden foil shall never breed distrust


bastard of orleans

search out thy wit for secret policies
and we will make thee famous through the world


alencon

well set thy statue in some holy place
and have thee reverenced like a blessed saint
employ thee then sweet virgin for our good


joan la pucelle

then thus it must be this doth joan devise
by fair persuasions mix with sugar words
we will entice the duke of burgundy
to leave the talbot and to follow us


charles

ay marry sweeting if we could do that
france were no place for henry warriors
nor should that nation boast it so with us
but be extirped from our provinces


alencon

for ever should they be expulsed from france
and not have title of an earldom here


joan la pucelle

your honours shall perceive how i will work
to bring this matter to the wished end
drum sounds afar off
hark by the sound of drum you may perceive
their powers are marching unto paris-ward
here sound an english march enter and pass over at a distance talbot and his forces
there goes the talbot with his colours spread
and all the troops of english after him
french march enter burgundy and forces
now in the rearward comes the duke and his
fortune in favour makes him lag behind
summon a parley we will talk with him
trumpets sound a parley


charles

a parley with the duke of burgundy


burgundy

who craves a parley with the burgundy


joan la pucelle

the princely charles of france thy countryman


burgundy

what say thou charles for i am marching hence


charles

speak pucelle and enchant him with thy words


joan la pucelle

brave burgundy undoubted hope of france
stay let thy humble handmaid speak to thee


burgundy

speak on but be not over-tedious


joan la pucelle

look on thy country look on fertile france
and see the cities and the towns defaced
by wasting ruin of the cruel foe
as looks the mother on her lowly babe
when death doth close his tender dying eyes
see see the pining malady of france
behold the wounds the most unnatural wounds
which thou thyself hast given her woful breast
o turn thy edged sword another way
strike those that hurt and hurt not those that help
one drop of blood drawn from thy country bosom
should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore
return thee therefore with a flood of tears
and wash away thy country stained spots


burgundy

either she hath bewitch me with her words
or nature makes me suddenly relent


joan la pucelle

besides all french and france exclaims on thee
doubting thy birth and lawful progeny
who joint thou with but with a lordly nation
that will not trust thee but for profit sake
when talbot hath set footing once in france
and fashion thee that instrument of ill
who then but english henry will be lord
and thou be thrust out like a fugitive
call we to mind and mark but this for proof
was not the duke of orleans thy foe
and was he not in england prisoner
but when they heard he was thine enemy
they set him free without his ransom paid
in spite of burgundy and all his friends
see then thou fight against thy countrymen
and joint with them will be thy slaughtermen
come come return return thou wandering lord
charles and the rest will take thee in their arms


burgundy

i am vanquished these haughty words of hers
have batter me like roaring cannon-shot
and made me almost yield upon my knees
forgive me country and sweet countrymen
and lords accept this hearty kind embrace
my forces and my power of men are yours
so farewell talbot ill no longer trust thee


joan la pucelle

aside  done like a frenchman turn and turn again


charles

welcome brave duke thy friendship makes us fresh


bastard of orleans

and doth beget new courage in our breasts


alencon

pucelle hath bravely play her part in this
and doth deserve a coronet of gold

now let us on my lords and join our powers
and seek how we may prejudice the foe

my gracious sovereign as i rode from calais
to haste unto your coronation
a letter was deliver to my hands
writ to your grace from the duke of burgundy


talbot

shame to the duke of burgundy and thee
i vow base knight when i did meet thee next
to tear the garter from thy craven leg
plucking it off
which i have done because unworthily
thou wast installed in that high degree
pardon me princely henry and the rest
this dastard at the battle of patay
when but in all i was six thousand strong
and that the french were almost ten to one
before we met or that a stroke was given
like to a trusty squire did run away
in which assault we lost twelve hundred men
myself and divers gentlemen beside
were there surprised and taken prisoners
then judge great lords if i have done amiss
or whether that such cowards ought to wear
this ornament of knighthood yea or no


gloucester

to say the truth this fact was infamous
and ill beseeming any common man
much more a knight a captain and a leader


talbot

when first this order was ordain my lords
knights of the garter were of noble birth
valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage
such as were grown to credit by the wars
not fearing death nor shrinking for distress
but always resolute in most extremes
he then that is not furnish in this sort
doth but usurp the sacred name of knight
profaning this most honourable order
and should if i were worthy to be judge
be quite degraded like a hedge-born swain
that doth presume to boast of gentle blood


king henry vi

stain to thy countrymen thou hear thy doom
be packing therefore thou that wast a knight
henceforth we banish thee on pain of death
exit fastolfe
and now my lord protector view the letter
sent from our uncle duke of burgundy


gloucester

what means his grace that he hath changed his style
no more but plain and bluntly to the king
hath he forgot he is his sovereign
or doth this churlish superscription
pretend some alteration in good will
what here
reads
i have upon especial cause
moved with compassion of my country wreck
together with the pitiful complaints
of such as your oppression feeds upon
forsaken your pernicious faction
and join with charles the rightful king of france
o monstrous treachery can this be so
that in alliance amity and oaths
there should be found such false dissembling guile


king henry vi

what doth my uncle burgundy revolt


gloucester

he doth my lord and is become your foe


king henry vi

is that the worst this letter doth contain


gloucester

it is the worst and all my lord he writes


king henry vi

why then lord talbot there shall talk with him
and give him chastisement for this abuse
how say you my lord are you not content


talbot

content my liege yes but that i am prevented
i should have begg i might have been employ

and wherefore crave you combat or with whom


vernon

basset

and i with him for he hath done me wrong


king henry vi

what is that wrong whereof you both complain
first let me know and then ill answer you


basset

crossing the sea from england into france
this fellow here with envious carping tongue
upbraided me about the rose i wear
saying the sanguine colour of the leaves
did represent my master blushing cheeks
when stubbornly he did repugn the truth
about a certain question in the law
argued betwixt the duke of york and him
with other vile and ignominious terms
in confutation of which rude reproach
and in defence of my lord worthiness
i crave the benefit of law of arms


vernon

and that is my petition noble lord
for though he seem with forged quaint conceit
to set a gloss upon his bold intent
yet know my lord i was provoked by him
and he first took exceptions at this badge
pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
bewray the faintness of my master heart


york

will not this malice somerset be left


somerset

your private grudge my lord of york will out
though neer so cunningly you smother it


king henry vi

good lord what madness rules in brainsick men
when for so slight and frivolous a cause
such factious emulations shall arise
good cousins both of york and somerset
quiet yourselves i pray and be at peace


york

let this dissension first be tried by fight
and then your highness shall command a peace


somerset

the quarrel toucheth none but us alone
betwixt ourselves let us decide it then


york

there is my pledge accept it somerset


vernon

nay let it rest where it began at first


basset

confirm it so mine honourable lord


gloucester

confirm it so confounded be your strife
and perish ye with your audacious prate
presumptuous vassals are you not ashamed
with this immodest clamorous outrage
to trouble and disturb the king and us
and you my lords methinks you do not well
to bear with their perverse objections
much less to take occasion from their mouths
to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves
let me persuade you take a better course


exeter

it grieves his highness good my lords be friends


king henry vi

come hither you that would be combatants
henceforth i charge you as you love our favour
quite to forget this quarrel and the cause
and you my lords remember where we are
in france amongst a fickle wavering nation
if they perceive dissension in our looks
and that within ourselves we disagree
how will their grudging stomachs be provoked
to wilful disobedience and rebel
beside what infamy will there arise
when foreign princes shall be certified
that for a toy a thing of no regard
king henry peers and chief nobility
destroy themselves and lost the realm of france
o think upon the conquest of my father
my tender years and let us not forego
that for a trifle that was bought with blood
let me be umpire in this doubtful strife
i see no reason if i wear this rose
putting on a red rose
that any one should therefore be suspicious
i more incline to somerset than york
both are my kinsmen and i love them both
as well they may upbraid me with my crown
because forsooth the king of scots is crown
but your discretions better can persuade
than i am able to instruct or teach
and therefore as we hither came in peace
so let us still continue peace and love
cousin of york we institute your grace
to be our regent in these parts of france
and good my lord of somerset unite
your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot
and like true subjects sons of your progenitors
go cheerfully together and digest
your angry choler on your enemies
ourself my lord protector and the rest
after some respite will return to calais
from thence to england where i hope ere long
to be presented by your victories
with charles alencon and that traitorous rout
flourish exeunt all but york warwick exeter and vernon


warwick

my lord of york i promise you the king
prettily methought did play the orator


york

and so he did but yet i like it not
in that he wears the badge of somerset


warwick

tush that was but his fancy blame him not
i dare presume sweet prince he thought no harm


york

an if i wist he did but let it rest
other affairs must now be managed
exeunt all but exeter


exeter

well didst thou richard to suppress thy voice
for had the passions of thy heart burst out
i fear we should have seen decipher there
more rancorous spite more furious raging broils
than yet can be imagined or supposed
but howsoeer no simple man that sees
this jarring discord of nobility
this shouldering of each other in the court
this factious bandying of their favourites
but that it doth presage some ill event
tis much when sceptres are in children hands
but more when envy breeds unkind division
there comes the rain there begins confusion

trumpet sounds enter general and others aloft
english john talbot captains calls you forth
servant in arms to harry king of england
and thus he would open your city gates
be humble to us call my sovereign yours
and do him homage as obedient subjects
and ill withdraw me and my bloody power
but if you frown upon this proffer peace
you tempt the fury of my three attendants
lean famine quartering steel and climbing fire
who in a moment even with the earth
shall lay your stately and air-braving towers
if you forsake the offer of their love


general

thou ominous and fearful owl of death
our nation terror and their bloody scourge
the period of thy tyranny approacheth
on us thou canst not enter but by death
for i protest we are well fortified
and strong enough to issue out and fight
if thou retire the dauphin well appointed
stands with the snares of war to tangle thee
on either hand thee there are squadrons pitch
to wall thee from the liberty of flight
and no way canst thou turn thee for redress
but death doth front thee with apparent spoil
and pale destruction meets thee in the face
ten thousand french have taen the sacrament
to rive their dangerous artillery
upon no christian soul but english talbot
lo there thou stand a breathing valiant man
of an invincible unconquer spirit
this is the latest glory of thy praise
that i thy enemy due thee withal
for ere the glass that now begins to run
finish the process of his sandy hour
these eyes that see thee now well coloured
shall see thee wither bloody pale and dead
drum afar off
hark hark the dauphin drum a warning bell
sings heavy music to thy timorous soul
and mine shall ring thy dire departure out
exeunt general   c


talbot

he fables not i hear the enemy
out some light horsemen and peruse their wings
o negligent and heedless discipline
how are we park and bounded in a pale
a little herd of england timorous deer
mazed with a yelping kennel of french curs
if we be english deer be then in blood
not rascal-like to fall down with a pinch
but rather moody-mad and desperate stags
turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel
and make the cowards stand aloof at bay
sell every man his life as dear as mine
and they shall find dear deer of us my friends
god and saint george talbot and england right
prosper our colours in this dangerous fight

to bid his young son welcome to his grave

should bring thy father to his drooping chair
but o malignant and ill-boding stars
now thou art come unto a feast of death
a terrible and unavoided danger
therefore dear boy mount on my swiftest horse
and ill direct thee how thou shalt escape
by sudden flight come dally not be gone


john talbot

is my name talbot and am i your son
and shall i fly o if you love my mother
dishonour not her honourable name
to make a bastard and a slave of me
the world will say he is not talbot blood
that basely fled when noble talbot stood


talbot

fly to revenge my death if i be slain


john talbot

he that flies so will neer return again


talbot

if we both stay we both are sure to die


john talbot

then let me stay and father do you fly
your loss is great so your regard should be
my worth unknown no loss is known in me
upon my death the french can little boast
in yours they will in you all hopes are lost
flight cannot stain the honour you have won
but mine it will that no exploit have done
you fled for vantage everyone will swear
but if i bow theyll say it was for fear
there is no hope that ever i will stay
if the first hour i shrink and run away
here on my knee i beg mortality
rather than life preserved with infamy


talbot

shall all thy mother hopes lie in one tomb


john talbot

ay rather than ill shame my mother womb


talbot

upon my blessing i command thee go


john talbot

to fight i will but not to fly the foe


talbot

part of thy father may be saved in thee


john talbot

no part of him but will be shame in me


talbot

thou never hadst renown nor canst not lose it


john talbot

yes your renowned name shall flight abuse it


talbot

thy father charge shall clear thee from that stain


john talbot

you cannot witness for me being slain
if death be so apparent then both fly


talbot

my age was never tainted with such shame


john talbot

and shall my youth be guilty of such blame
no more can i be sever from your side
than can yourself yourself in twain divide
stay go do what you will the like do i

from thee my boy and had the maidenhood
of thy first fight i soon encountered
and interchanging blows i quickly shed
some of his bastard blood and in disgrace
bespoke him thus contaminated base
and misbegotten blood i spill of thine
mean and right poor for that pure blood of mine
which thou didst force from talbot my brave boy
here purposing the bastard to destroy
came in strong rescue speak thy father care
art thou not weary john how dost thou fare
wilt thou yet leave the battle boy and fly
now thou art seal the son of chivalry
fly to revenge my death when i am dead
the help of one stands me in little stead
o too much folly is it well i wot
to hazard all our lives in one small boat
if i to-day die not with frenchmen rage
to-morrow i shall die with mickle age
by me they nothing gain an if i stay
tis but the shortening of my life one day
in thee thy mother dies our household name
my death revenge thy youth and england fame
all these and more we hazard by thy stay
all these are saved if thou wilt fly away


john talbot

the sword of orleans hath not made me smart
these words of yours draw life-blood from my heart
on that advantage bought with such a shame
to save a paltry life and slay bright fame
before young talbot from old talbot fly
the coward horse that bears me fail and die
and like me to the peasant boys of france
to be shame scorn and subject of mischance
surely by all the glory you have won
an if i fly i am not talbot son
then talk no more of flight it is no boot

when he perceived me shrink and on my knee
his bloody sword he brandish over me
and like a hungry lion did commence
rough deeds of rage and stern impatience
but when my angry guardant stood alone
tendering my ruin and assail of none
dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart
suddenly made him from my side to start
into the clustering battle of the french

yet if this servile usage once offend
go and be free again as suffolk friend
she is going
o stay i have no power to let her pass
my hand would free her but my heart says no
as plays the sun upon the glassy streams
twinkling another counterfeited beam
so seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes
fain would i woo her yet i dare not speak
ill call for pen and ink and write my mind
fie de la pole disable not thyself
hast not a tongue is she not here

how canst thou tell she will deny thy suit
before thou make a trial of her love

but issued from the progeny of kings
virtuous and holy chosen from above
by inspiration of celestial grace
to work exceeding miracles on earth
i never had to do with wicked spirits
but you that are polluted with your lusts
stain with the guiltless blood of innocents
corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices
because you want the grace that others have
you judge it straight a thing impossible
to compass wonders but by help of devils
no misconceived joan of arc hath been
a virgin from her tender infancy
chaste and immaculate in very thought
whose maiden blood thus rigorously effused
will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven


york

ay ay away with her to execution


warwick

and hark ye sirs because she is a maid
spare for no faggots let there be enow
place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake
that so her torture may be shortened

i am with child ye bloody homicides
murder not then the fruit within my womb
although ye hale me to a violent death


york

now heaven forfend the holy maid with child


warwick

the greatest miracle that eer ye wrought
is all your strict preciseness come to this


york

she and the dauphin have been juggling
i did imagine what would be her refuge


warwick

well go to well have no bastards live
especially since charles must father it


joan la pucelle

you are deceived my child is none of his
it was alencon that enjoy my love


york

joan la pucelle

york

york

and yet forsooth she is a virgin pure
strumpet thy words condemn thy brat and thee

joan la pucelle

enter cardinal of winchester attended
cardinal


of winchester

lord regent i do greet your excellence
with letters of commission from the king
for know my lords the states of christendom
moved with remorse of these outrageous broils
have earnestly implored a general peace
betwixt our nation and the aspiring french
and here at hand the dauphin and his train
approacheth to confer about some matter


york

is all our travail turn to this effect
after the slaughter of so many peers
so many captains gentlemen and soldiers
that in this quarrel have been overthrown
and sold their bodies for their country benefit
shall we at last conclude effeminate peace
have we not lost most part of all the towns
by treason falsehood and by treachery
our great progenitors had conquered
o warwick warwick i foresee with grief
the utter loss of all the realm of france


warwick

be patient york if we conclude a peace
it shall be with such strict and severe covenants
as little shall the frenchmen gain thereby
enter charles alencon bastard of orleans reignier and others


charles

since lords of england it is thus agreed
that peaceful truce shall be proclaim in france
we come to be informed by yourselves
what the conditions of that league must be


york

speak winchester for boiling choler chokes
the hollow passage of my poison voice
by sight of these our baleful enemies
cardinal


of winchester

charles and the rest it is enacted thus
that in regard king henry gives consent
of mere compassion and of lenity
to ease your country of distressful war
and suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace
you shall become true liegemen to his crown
and charles upon condition thou wilt swear
to pay him tribute submit thyself
thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him
and still enjoy thy regal dignity


alencon

must he be then as shadow of himself
adorn his temples with a coronet
and yet in substance and authority
retain but privilege of a private man
this proffer is absurd and reasonless


charles

tis known already that i am possess
with more than half the gallian territories
and therein reverenced for their lawful king
shall i for lucre of the rest unvanquish
detract so much from that prerogative
as to be call but viceroy of the whole
no lord ambassador ill rather keep
that which i have than coveting for more
be cast from possibility of all


york

insulting charles hast thou by secret means
used intercession to obtain a league
and now the matter grows to compromise
stand thou aloof upon comparison
either accept the title thou usurp
of benefit proceeding from our king
and not of any challenge of desert
or we will plague thee with incessant wars


reignier

my lord you do not well in obstinacy
to cavil in the course of this contract
if once it be neglected ten to one
we shall not find like opportunity


alencon

to say the truth it is your policy
to save your subjects from such massacre
and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
by our proceeding in hostility
and therefore take this compact of a truce
although you break it when your pleasure serves


warwick

how say thou charles shall our condition stand


charles

it shall
only reserved you claim no interest
in any of our towns of garrison


york

then swear allegiance to his majesty
as thou art knight never to disobey
nor be rebellious to the crown of england
thou nor thy nobles to the crown of england
so now dismiss your army when ye please
hang up your ensign let your drums be still
for here we entertain a solemn peace

scene v london the palace

enter suffolk in conference with king henry vi gloucester and exeter


king henry vi

your wondrous rare description noble earl
of beauteous margaret hath astonish me
her virtues graced with external gifts
do breed love settled passions in my heart
and like as rigor of tempestuous gusts
provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide
so am i driven by breath of her renown
either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
where i may have fruition of her love


suffolk

tush my good lord this superficial tale
is but a preface of her worthy praise
the chief perfections of that lovely dame
had i sufficient skill to utter them
would make a volume of enticing lines
able to ravish any dull conceit
and which is more she is not so divine
so full-replete with choice of all delights
but with as humble lowliness of mind
she is content to be at your command
command i mean of virtuous chaste intents
to love and honour henry as her lord


king henry vi

and otherwise will henry neer presume
therefore my lord protector give consent
that margaret may be england royal queen


gloucester

so should i give consent to flatter sin
you know my lord your highness is betroth
unto another lady of esteem
how shall we then dispense with that contract
and not deface your honour with reproach


suffolk

as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths
or one that at a triumph having vow
to try his strength forsaketh yet the lists
by reason of his adversary odds
a poor earl daughter is unequal odds
and therefore may be broke without offence


gloucester

why what i pray is margaret more than that
her father is no better than an earl
although in glorious titles he excel


suffolk

yes lord her father is a king
the king of naples and jerusalem
and of such great authority in france
as his alliance will confirm our peace
and keep the frenchmen in allegiance


gloucester

and so the earl of armagnac may do
because he is near kinsman unto charles


exeter

beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower
where reignier sooner will receive than give


suffolk

a dower my lords disgrace not so your king
that he should be so abject base and poor
to choose for wealth and not for perfect love
henry is able to enrich his queen
and not seek a queen to make him rich
so worthless peasants bargain for their wives
as market-men for oxen sheep or horse
marriage is a matter of more worth
than to be dealt in by attorneyship
not whom we will but whom his grace affects
must be companion of his nuptial bed
and therefore lords since he affects her most
it most of all these reasons bindeth us
in our opinions she should be preferr
for what is wedlock forced but a hell
an age of discord and continual strife
whereas the contrary bringeth bliss
and is a pattern of celestial peace
whom should we match with henry being a king
but margaret that is daughter to a king
her peerless feature joined with her birth
approves her fit for none but for a king
her valiant courage and undaunted spirit
more than in women commonly is seen
will answer our hope in issue of a king
for henry son unto a conqueror
is likely to beget more conquerors
if with a lady of so high resolve
as is fair margaret he be link in love
then yield my lords and here conclude with me
that margaret shall be queen and none but she


king henry vi

whether it be through force of your report
my noble lord of suffolk or for that
my tender youth was never yet attaint
with any passion of inflaming love
i cannot tell but this i am assured
i feel such sharp dissension in my breast
such fierce alarums both of hope and fear
as i am sick with working of my thoughts
take therefore shipping post my lord to france
agree to any covenants and procure
that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come
to cross the seas to england and be crown
king henry faithful and anointed queen
for your expenses and sufficient charge
among the people gather up a tenth
be gone i say for till you do return
i rest perplexed with a thousand cares
and you good uncle banish all offence
if you do censure me by what you were
not what you are i know it will excuse
this sudden execution of my will
and so conduct me where from company
i may revolve and ruminate my grief
exit


gloucester

ay grief i fear me both at first and last
exeunt gloucester and exeter


suffolk

thus suffolk hath prevail and thus he goes
as did the youthful paris once to greece
with hope to find the like event in love
but prosper better than the trojan did
margaret shall now be queen and rule the king
but i will rule both her the king and realm

the which in every language i pronounce
stuffing the ears of men with false reports
i speak of peace while covert enmity
under the smile of safety wounds the world
and who but rumour who but only i

whiles the big year swoln with some other grief
is thought with child by the stern tyrant war
and no such matter rumour is a pipe
blown by surmises jealousies conjectures
and of so easy and so plain a stop
that the blunt monster with uncounted heads
the still-discordant wavering multitude
can play upon it but what need i thus
my well-known body to anatomize
among my household why is rumour here
i run before king harry victory
who in a bloody field by shrewsbury
hath beaten down young hotspur and his troops
quenching the flame of bold rebellion
even with the rebel blood but what mean i
to speak so true at first my office is
to noise abroad that harry monmouth fell
under the wrath of noble hotspur sword
and that the king before the douglas rage
stoop his anointed head as low as death
this have i rumour through the peasant towns
between that royal field of shrewsbury
and this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone
where hotspur father old northumberland
lies crafty-sick the posts come tiring on
and not a man of them brings other news

northumberland

good an god will


lord bardolph

as good as heart can wish
the king is almost wounded to the death
and in the fortune of my lord your son
prince harry slain outright and both the blunts
kill by the hand of douglas young prince john
and westmoreland and stafford fled the field
and harry monmouth brawn the hulk sir john
is prisoner to your son o such a day
so fought so follow and so fairly won
came not till now to dignify the times
since caesar fortunes


northumberland

how is this derived
saw you the field came you from shrewsbury


lord bardolph

i spake with one my lord that came from thence
a gentleman well bred and of good name
that freely render me these news for true


northumberland

here comes my servant travers whom i sent
on tuesday last to listen after news
enter travers


lord bardolph

my lord i over-rode him on the way
and he is furnish with no certainties
more than he haply may retail from me


northumberland

now travers what good tidings comes with you


travers

my lord sir john umfrevile turn me back
with joyful tidings and being better horsed
out-rode me after him came spurring hard
a gentleman almost forspent with speed
that stopp by me to breathe his bloodied horse
he ask the way to chester and of him
i did demand what news from shrewsbury
he told me that rebellion had bad luck
and that young harry percy spur was cold
with that he gave his able horse the head
and bending forward struck his armed heels
against the panting sides of his poor jade
up to the rowel-head and starting so
he seem in running to devour the way
staying no longer question


northumberland

ha again
said he young harry percy spur was cold
of hotspur coldspur that rebellion
had met ill luck


lord bardolph

my lord ill tell you what
if my young lord your son have not the day
upon mine honour for a silken point
ill give my barony never talk of it


northumberland

why should that gentleman that rode by travers
give then such instances of loss


lord bardolph

who he
he was some hilding fellow that had stolen
the horse he rode on and upon my life
spoke at a venture look here comes more news
enter morton


northumberland

yea this man brow like to a title-leaf
foretells the nature of a tragic volume
so looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
hath left a witness usurpation
say morton didst thou come from shrewsbury


morton

i ran from shrewsbury my noble lord
where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
to fright our party


northumberland

how doth my son and brother
thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek
is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand
even such a man so faint so spiritless
so dull so dead in look so woe-begone
drew priam curtain in the dead of night
and would have told him half his troy was burnt
but priam found the fire ere he his tongue
and i my percy death ere thou report it
this thou wouldst say your son did thus and thus
your brother thus so fought the noble douglas
stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds
but in the end to stop my ear indeed
thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise
ending with brother son and all are dead


morton

douglas is living and your brother yet
but for my lord your son 


northumberland

why he is dead
see what a ready tongue suspicion hath
he that but fears the thing he would not know
hath by instinct knowledge from others eyes
that what he fear is chanced yet speak morton
tell thou an earl his divination lies
and i will take it as a sweet disgrace
and make thee rich for doing me such wrong


morton

you are too great to be by me gainsaid
your spirit is too true your fears too certain


northumberland

yet for all this say not that percy dead
i see a strange confession in thine eye
thou shakest thy head and hold it fear or sin
to speak a truth if he be slain say so
the tongue offends not that reports his death
and he doth sin that doth belie the dead
not he which says the dead is not alive
yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
hath but a losing office and his tongue
sounds ever after as a sullen bell
remember tolling a departing friend


lord bardolph

i cannot think my lord your son is dead


morton

i am sorry i should force you to believe
that which i would to god i had not seen
but these mine eyes saw him in bloody state
rendering faint quittance wearied and out-breathed
to harry monmouth whose swift wrath beat down
the never-daunted percy to the earth
from whence with life he never more sprung up
in few his death whose spirit lent a fire
even to the dullest peasant in his camp
being bruited once took fire and heat away
from the best temper courage in his troops
for from his metal was his party steel
which once in him abated all the rest
turn on themselves like dull and heavy lead
and as the thing that heavy in itself
upon enforcement flies with greatest speed
so did our men heavy in hotspur loss
lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
that arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
than did our soldiers aiming at their safety
fly from the field then was the noble worcester
too soon taen prisoner and that furious scot
the bloody douglas whose well-labouring sword
had three times slain the appearance of the king
gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
of those that turn their backs and in his flight
stumbling in fear was took the sum of all
is that the king hath won and hath sent out
a speedy power to encounter you my lord
under the conduct of young lancaster
and westmoreland this is the news at full


northumberland

for this i shall have time enough to mourn
in poison there is physic and these news
having been well that would have made me sick
being sick have in some measure made me well
and as the wretch whose fever-weaken joints
like strengthless hinges buckle under life
impatient of his fit breaks like a fire
out of his keeper arms even so my limbs
weaken with grief being now enraged with grief
are thrice themselves hence therefore thou nice crutch
a scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
must glove this hand and hence thou sickly quoif
thou art a guard too wanton for the head
which princes flesh with conquest aim to hit
now bind my brows with iron and approach
the ragged hour that time and spite dare bring
to frown upon the enraged northumberland
let heaven kiss earth now let not nature hand
keep the wild flood confined let order die
and let this world no longer be a stage
to feed contention in a lingering act
but let one spirit of the first-born cain
reign in all bosoms that each heart being set
on bloody courses the rude scene may end
and darkness be the burier of the dead


travers

this strained passion doth you wrong my lord


lord bardolph

sweet earl divorce not wisdom from your honour


morton

the lives of all your loving complices
lean on your health the which if you give oer
to stormy passion must perforce decay
you cast the event of war my noble lord
and summ the account of chance before you said
let us make head it was your presurmise
that in the dole of blows your son might drop
you knew he walk oer perils on an edge
more likely to fall in than to get oer
you were advised his flesh was capable
of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
would lift him where most trade of danger ranged
yet did you say go forth and none of this
though strongly apprehended could restrain
the stiff-borne action what hath then befallen
or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth
more than that being which was like to be


lord bardolph

we all that are engaged to this loss
knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
that if we wrought our life twas ten to one
and yet we ventured for the gain proposed
choked the respect of likely peril fear
and since we are oerset venture again
come we will all put forth body and goods


morton

tis more than time and my most noble lord
i hear for certain and do speak the truth
the gentle archbishop of york is up
with well-appointed powers he is a man
who with a double surety binds his followers
my lord your son had only but the corpse
but shadows and the shows of men to fight
for that same word rebellion did divide
the action of their bodies from their souls
and they did fight with queasiness constrain
as men drink potions that their weapons only
seem on our side but for their spirits and souls
this word rebellion it had froze them up
as fish are in a pond but now the bishop
turns insurrection to religion
supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts
he followed both with body and with mind
and doth enlarge his rising with the blood
of fair king richard scraped from pomfret stones
derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause
tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land
gasping for life under great bolingbroke
and more and less do flock to follow him


northumberland

i knew of this before but to speak truth
this present grief had wiped it from my mind
go in with me and counsel every man
the aptest way for safety and revenge
get posts and letters and make friends with speed
never so few and never yet more need

you it is the disease of not listening the malady
of not marking that i am troubled withal
lord chief-justiceto punish you by the heels would amend the
attention of your ears and i care not if i do
become your physician


falstaff

i am as poor as job my lord but not so patient
your lordship may minister the potion of
imprisonment to me in respect of poverty but how
should i be your patient to follow your
prescriptions the wise may make some dram of a
scruple or indeed a scruple itself
lord chief-justicei sent for you when there were matters against you
for your life to come speak with me


falstaff

as i was then advised by my learned counsel in the
laws of this land-service i did not come
lord chief-justicewell the truth is sir john you live in great infamy


falstaff

he that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less
lord chief-justiceyour means are very slender and your waste is great


falstaff

i would it were otherwise i would my means were
greater and my waist slenderer
lord chief-justiceyou have misled the youthful prince


falstaff

the young prince hath misled me i am the fellow
with the great belly and he my dog
lord chief-justicewell i am loath to gall a new-healed wound your
day service at shrewsbury hath a little gilded
over your night exploit on gad-hill you may
thank the unquiet time for your quiet oer-posting
that action


falstaff

my lord
lord chief-justicebut since all is well keep it so wake not a
sleeping wolf


falstaff

to wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox
lord chief-justicewhat you are as a candle the better part burnt
out


falstaff

a wassail candle my lord all tallow if i did say
of wax my growth would approve the truth
lord chief-justicethere is not a white hair on your face but should
have his effect of gravity


falstaff

his effect of gravy gravy gravy
lord chief-justiceyou follow the young prince up and down like his
ill angel


falstaff

not so my lord your ill angel is light but i hope
he that looks upon me will take me without weighing
and yet in some respects i grant i cannot go i
cannot tell virtue is of so little regard in these
costermonger times that true valour is turned
bear-herd pregnancy is made a tapster and hath
his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings all the
other gifts appertinent to man as the malice of
this age shapes them are not worth a gooseberry
you that are old consider not the capacities of us
that are young you do measure the heat of our
livers with the bitterness of your galls and we
that are in the vaward of our youth i must confess
are wags too
lord chief-justicedo you set down your name in the scroll of youth
that are written down old with all the characters of
age have you not a moist eye a dry hand a
yellow cheek a white beard a decreasing leg an
increasing belly is not your voice broken your
wind short your chin double your wit single and
every part about you blasted with antiquity and
will you yet call yourself young fie fie fie sir john


falstaff

my lord i was born about three of the clock in the
afternoon with a white head and something a round
belly for my voice i have lost it with halloing
and singing of anthems to approve my youth
further i will not the truth is i am only old in
judgment and understanding and he that will caper
with me for a thousand marks let him lend me the
money and have at him for the box of the ear that
the prince gave you he gave it like a rude prince
and you took it like a sensible lord i have
chequed him for it and the young lion repents
marry not in ashes and sackcloth but in new silk
and old sack
lord chief-justicewell god send the prince a better companion


falstaff

god send the companion a better prince i cannot
rid my hands of him
lord chief-justicewell the king hath severed you and prince harry i
hear you are going with lord john of lancaster
against the archbishop and the earl of
northumberland


falstaff

yea i thank your pretty sweet wit for it but look
you pray all you that kiss my lady peace at home
that our armies join not in a hot day for by the
lord i take but two shirts out with me and i mean
not to sweat extraordinarily if it be a hot day
and i brandish any thing but a bottle i would i
might never spit white again there is not a
dangerous action can peep out his head but i am
thrust upon it well i cannot last ever but it
was alway yet the trick of our english nation if
they have a good thing to make it too common if
ye will needs say i am an old man you should give
me rest i would to god my name were not so
terrible to the enemy as it is i were better to be
eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to
nothing with perpetual motion
lord chief-justicewell be honest be honest and god bless your
expedition


falstaff

will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to
furnish me forth
lord chief-justicenot a penny not a penny you are too impatient to
bear crosses fare you well commend me to my
cousin westmoreland
exeunt chief-justice and servant


falstaff

if i do fillip me with a three-man beetle a man
can no more separate age and covetousness than a
can part young limbs and lechery but the gout
galls the one and the pox pinches the other and
so both the degrees prevent my curses boy

sir


falstaff

what money is in my purse


page

seven groats and two pence


falstaff

i can get no remedy against this consumption of the
purse borrowing only lingers and lingers it out
but the disease is incurable go bear this letter
to my lord of lancaster this to the prince this
to the earl of westmoreland and this to old
mistress ursula whom i have weekly sworn to marry
since i perceived the first white hair on my chin
about it you know where to find me
exit page
a pox of this gout or a gout of this pox for
the one or the other plays the rogue with my great

scene iii york the archbishop palace

enter the archbishop of york the lords hastings mowbray and bardolph


archbishop of york

thus have you heard our cause and known our means
and my most noble friends i pray you all
speak plainly your opinions of our hopes
and first lord marshal what say you to it


mowbray

i well allow the occasion of our arms
but gladly would be better satisfied
how in our means we should advance ourselves
to look with forehead bold and big enough
upon the power and puissance of the king


hastings

our present musters grow upon the file
to five and twenty thousand men of choice
and our supplies live largely in the hope
of great northumberland whose bosom burns
with an incensed fire of injuries


lord bardolph

the question then lord hastings standeth thus
whether our present five and twenty thousand
may hold up head without northumberland


hastings

with him we may


lord bardolph

yea marry there the point
but if without him we be thought too feeble
my judgment is we should not step too far
till we had his assistance by the hand
for in a theme so bloody-faced as this
conjecture expectation and surmise
of aids incertain should not be admitted


archbishop of york

tis very true lord bardolph for indeed
it was young hotspur case at shrewsbury


lord bardolph

it was my lord who lined himself with hope
eating the air on promise of supply
flattering himself in project of a power
much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts
and so with great imagination
proper to madmen led his powers to death
and winking leap into destruction


hastings

but by your leave it never yet did hurt
to lay down likelihoods and forms of hope


lord bardolph

yes if this present quality of war
indeed the instant action a cause on foot
lives so in hope as in an early spring
we see the appearing buds which to prove fruit
hope gives not so much warrant as despair
that frosts will bite them when we mean to build
we first survey the plot then draw the model
and when we see the figure of the house
then must we rate the cost of the erection
which if we find outweighs ability
what do we then but draw anew the model
in fewer offices or at last desist
to build at all much more in this great work
which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
and set another up should we survey
the plot of situation and the model
consent upon a sure foundation
question surveyors know our own estate
how able such a work to undergo
to weigh against his opposite or else
we fortify in paper and in figures
using the names of men instead of men
like one that draws the model of a house
beyond his power to build it who half through
gives oer and leaves his part-created cost
a naked subject to the weeping clouds
and waste for churlish winter tyranny


hastings

grant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth
should be still-born and that we now possess
the utmost man of expectation
i think we are a body strong enough
even as we are to equal with the king


lord bardolph

what is the king but five and twenty thousand


hastings

to us no more nay not so much lord bardolph
for his divisions as the times do brawl
are in three heads one power against the french
and one against glendower perforce a third
must take up us so is the unfirm king
in three divided and his coffers sound
with hollow poverty and emptiness


archbishop of york

that he should draw his several strengths together
and come against us in full puissance
need not be dreaded


hastings

if he should do so
he leaves his back unarm the french and welsh
baying him at the heels never fear that


lord bardolph

who is it like should lead his forces hither


hastings

the duke of lancaster and westmoreland
against the welsh himself and harry monmouth
but who is substituted gainst the french
i have no certain notice


archbishop of york

let us on
and publish the occasion of our arms
the commonwealth is sick of their own choice
their over-greedy love hath surfeited
an habitation giddy and unsure
hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart
o thou fond many with what loud applause
didst thou beat heaven with blessing bolingbroke
before he was what thou wouldst have him be
and being now trimm in thine own desires
thou beastly feeder art so full of him
that thou provokest thyself to cast him up
so so thou common dog didst thou disgorge
thy glutton bosom of the royal richard
and now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up
and howl to find it what trust is in
these times
they that when richard lived would have him die
are now become enamour on his grave
thou that threw dust upon his goodly head
when through proud london he came sighing on
after the admired heels of bolingbroke
criest now o earth yield us that king again
and take thou this o thoughts of men accursed
past and to come seems best things present worst


mowbray

shall we go draw our numbers and set on


hastings

we are time subjects and time bids be gone

prince henry

before god i am exceeding weary


poins

ist come to that i had thought weariness durst not
have attached one of so high blood


prince henry

faith it does me though it discolours the
complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it doth
it not show vilely in me to desire small beer


poins

why a prince should not be so loosely studied as
to remember so weak a composition


prince henry

belike then my appetite was not princely got for
by my troth i do now remember the poor creature
small beer but indeed these humble
considerations make me out of love with my
greatness what a disgrace is it to me to remember
thy name or to know thy face to-morrow or to
take note how many pair of silk stockings thou
hast viz these and those that were thy
peach-coloured ones or to bear the inventory of thy
shirts as one for superfluity and another for
use but that the tennis-court-keeper knows better
than i for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when
thou keepest not racket there as thou hast not done
a great while because the rest of thy low
countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland
and god knows whether those that bawl out the ruins
of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom but the
midwives say the children are not in the fault
whereupon the world increases and kindreds are
mightily strengthened


poins

how ill it follows after you have laboured so hard
you should talk so idly tell me how many good
young princes would do so their fathers being so
sick as yours at this time is


prince henry

shall i tell thee one thing poins


poins

yes faith and let it be an excellent good thing


prince henry

it shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine


poins

go to i stand the push of your one thing that you
will tell


prince henry

marry i tell thee it is not meet that i should be
sad now my father is sick albeit i could tell
thee as to one it pleases me for fault of a
better to call my friend i could be sad and sad
indeed too


poins

very hardly upon such a subject


prince henry

by this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil
book as thou and falstaff for obduracy and
persistency let the end try the man but i tell
thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so
sick and keeping such vile company as thou art
hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow


poins

the reason


prince henry

what wouldst thou think of me if i should weep


poins

i would think thee a most princely hypocrite


prince henry

it would be every man thought and thou art a
blessed fellow to think as every man thinks never
a man thought in the world keeps the road-way
better than thine every man would think me an
hypocrite indeed and what accites your most
worshipful thought to think so


poins

why because you have been so lewd and so much
engraffed to falstaff


prince henry

and to thee


poins

by this light i am well spoke on i can hear it
with my own ears the worst that they can say of
me is that i am a second brother and that i am a
proper fellow of my hands and those two things i
confess i cannot help by the mass here comes bardolph

give even way unto my rough affairs
put not you on the visage of the times
and be like them to percy troublesome
lady


northumberland

i have given over i will speak no more
do what you will your wisdom be your guide


northumberland

alas sweet wife my honour is at pawn
and but my going nothing can redeem it


lady percy

o yet for god sake go not to these wars
the time was father that you broke your word
when you were more endeared to it than now
when your own percy when my heart dear harry
threw many a northward look to see his father
bring up his powers but he did long in vain
who then persuaded you to stay at home
there were two honours lost yours and your son
for yours the god of heaven brighten it
for his it stuck upon him as the sun
in the grey vault of heaven and by his light
did all the chivalry of england move
to do brave acts he was indeed the glass
wherein the noble youth did dress themselves
he had no legs that practised not his gait
and speaking thick which nature made his blemish
became the accents of the valiant
for those that could speak low and tardily
would turn their own perfection to abuse
to seem like him so that in speech in gait
in diet in affections of delight
in military rules humours of blood
he was the mark and glass copy and book
that fashion others and him o wondrous him
o miracle of men him did you leave
second to none unseconded by you
to look upon the hideous god of war
in disadvantage to abide a field
where nothing but the sound of hotspur name
did seem defensible so you left him
never o never do his ghost the wrong
to hold your honour more precise and nice
with others than with him let them alone
the marshal and the archbishop are strong
had my sweet harry had but half their numbers
to-day might i hanging on hotspur neck
have talk of monmouth grave


northumberland

beshrew your heart
fair daughter you do draw my spirits from me
with new lamenting ancient oversights
but i must go and meet with danger there
or it will seek me in another place
and find me worse provided
lady


northumberland

o fly to scotland
till that the nobles and the armed commons
have of their puissance made a little taste


lady percy

if they get ground and vantage of the king
then join you with them like a rib of steel
to make strength stronger but for all our loves
first let them try themselves so did your son
he was so suffer so came i a widow
and never shall have length of life enough
to rain upon remembrance with mine eyes
that it may grow and sprout as high as heaven
for recordation to my noble husband


northumberland

come come go in with me tis with my mind
as with the tide swell up unto his height
that makes a still-stand running neither way
fain would i go to meet the archbishop
but many thousand reasons hold me back
i will resolve for scotland there am i

scene i westminster the palace

enter king henry iv in his nightgown with a page


king henry iv

go call the earls of surrey and of warwick
but ere they come bid them oer-read these letters
and well consider of them make good speed
exit page
how many thousand of my poorest subjects
are at this hour asleep o sleep o gentle sleep
nature soft nurse how have i frighted thee
that thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down
and steep my senses in forgetfulness
why rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribs
upon uneasy pallets stretching thee
and hush with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber
than in the perfumed chambers of the great
under the canopies of costly state
and lull with sound of sweetest melody
o thou dull god why liest thou with the vile
in loathsome beds and leavest the kingly couch
a watch-case or a common larum-bell
wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
seal up the ship-boy eyes and rock his brains
in cradle of the rude imperious surge
and in the visitation of the winds
who take the ruffian billows by the top
curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
with deafening clamour in the slippery clouds
that with the hurly death itself awakes
canst thou o partial sleep give thy repose
to the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude
and in the calmest and most stillest night
with all appliances and means to boot
deny it to a king then happy low lie down
uneasy lies the head that wears a crown
enter warwick and surrey


warwick

many good morrows to your majesty


king henry iv

is it good morrow lords


warwick

tis one oclock and past


king henry iv

why then good morrow to you all my lords
have you read oer the letters that i sent you


warwick

we have my liege


king henry iv

then you perceive the body of our kingdom
how foul it is what rank diseases grow
and with what danger near the heart of it


warwick

it is but as a body yet distemper
which to his former strength may be restored
with good advice and little medicine
my lord northumberland will soon be cool


king henry iv

o god that one might read the book of fate
and see the revolution of the times
make mountains level and the continent
weary of solid firmness melt itself
into the sea and other times to see
the beachy girdle of the ocean
too wide for neptune hips how chances mock
and changes fill the cup of alteration
with divers liquors o if this were seen
the happiest youth viewing his progress through
what perils past what crosses to ensue
would shut the book and sit him down and die
tis not ten years gone
since richard and northumberland great friends
did feast together and in two years after
were they at wars it is but eight years since
this percy was the man nearest my soul
who like a brother toil in my affairs
and laid his love and life under my foot
yea for my sake even to the eyes of richard
gave him defiance but which of you was by 
you cousin nevil as i may remember 
to warwick
when richard with his eye brimful of tears
then cheque and rated by northumberland
did speak these words now proved a prophecy
northumberland thou ladder by the which
my cousin bolingbroke ascends my throne
though then god knows i had no such intent
but that necessity so bow the state
that i and greatness were compell to kiss
the time shall come thus did he follow it
the time will come that foul sin gathering head
shall break into corruption so went on
foretelling this same time condition
and the division of our amity


warwick

there is a history in all men lives
figuring the nature of the times deceased
the which observed a man may prophesy
with a near aim of the main chance of things
as yet not come to life which in their seeds
and weak beginnings lie intreasured
such things become the hatch and brood of time
and by the necessary form of this
king richard might create a perfect guess
that great northumberland then false to him
would of that seed grow to a greater falseness
which should not find a ground to root upon
unless on you


king henry iv

are these things then necessities
then let us meet them like necessities
and that same word even now cries out on us
they say the bishop and northumberland
are fifty thousand strong


warwick

it cannot be my lord
rumour doth double like the voice and echo
the numbers of the fear please it your grace
to go to bed upon my soul my lord
the powers that you already have sent forth
shall bring this prize in very easily
to comfort you the more i have received
a certain instance that glendower is dead
your majesty hath been this fortnight ill
and these unseason hours perforce must add
unto your sickness


king henry iv

i will take your counsel
and were these inward wars once out of hand
we would dear lords unto the holy land

see the bottom of justice shallow lord lord how
subject we old men are to this vice of lying this
same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to
me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he
hath done about turnbull street and every third
word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the turk
tribute i do remember him at clement inn like a
man made after supper of a cheese-paring when a
was naked he was for all the world like a forked
radish with a head fantastically carved upon it
with a knife a was so forlorn that his
dimensions to any thick sight were invincible a
was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a
monkey and the whores called him mandrake a came
ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those
tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the
carmen whistle and swear they were his fancies or
his good-nights and now is this vice dagger
become a squire and talks as familiarly of john a
gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and
ill be sworn a neer saw him but once in the
tilt-yard and then he burst his head for crowding
among the marshal men i saw it and told john a
gaunt he beat his own name for you might have
thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin the
case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a
court and now has he land and beefs well ill
be acquainted with him if i return and it shall
go hard but i will make him a philosopher two
stones to me if the young dace be a bait for the
old pike i see no reason in the law of nature but i
may snap at him let time shape and there an end

act iv
scene i yorkshire gaultree forest

enter the archbishop of york mowbray lord hastings and others


archbishop of york

what is this forest call


hastings

tis gaultree forest ant shall please your grace


archbishop of york

here stand my lords and send discoverers forth
to know the numbers of our enemies


hastings

we have sent forth already


archbishop of york

tis well done
my friends and brethren in these great affairs
i must acquaint you that i have received
new-dated letters from northumberland
their cold intent tenor and substance thus
here doth he wish his person with such powers
as might hold sortance with his quality
the which he could not levy whereupon
he is retired to ripe his growing fortunes
to scotland and concludes in hearty prayers
that your attempts may overlive the hazard
and fearful melting of their opposite


mowbray

thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
and dash themselves to pieces
enter a messenger


hastings

now what news


messenger

west of this forest scarcely off a mile
in goodly form comes on the enemy
and by the ground they hide i judge their number
upon or near the rate of thirty thousand


mowbray

the just proportion that we gave them out
let us sway on and face them in the field


archbishop of york

what well-appointed leader fronts us here
enter westmoreland


mowbray

i think it is my lord of westmoreland


westmoreland

health and fair greeting from our general
the prince lord john and duke of lancaster


archbishop of york

say on my lord of westmoreland in peace
what doth concern your coming


westmoreland

then my lord
unto your grace do i in chief address
the substance of my speech if that rebellion
came like itself in base and abject routs
led on by bloody youth guarded with rags
and countenanced by boys and beggary
i say if damn commotion so appear
in his true native and most proper shape
you reverend father and these noble lords
had not been here to dress the ugly form
of base and bloody insurrection
with your fair honours you lord archbishop
whose see is by a civil peace maintained
whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch
whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor
whose white investments figure innocence
the dove and very blessed spirit of peace
wherefore do you so ill translate ourself
out of the speech of peace that bears such grace
into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war
turning your books to graves your ink to blood
your pens to lances and your tongue divine
to a trumpet and a point of war


archbishop of york

wherefore do i this so the question stands
briefly to this end we are all diseased
and with our surfeiting and wanton hours
have brought ourselves into a burning fever
and we must bleed for it of which disease
our late king richard being infected died
but my most noble lord of westmoreland
i take not on me here as a physician
nor do i as an enemy to peace
troop in the throngs of military men
but rather show awhile like fearful war
to diet rank minds sick of happiness
and purge the obstructions which begin to stop
our very veins of life hear me more plainly
i have in equal balance justly weigh
what wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer
and find our griefs heavier than our offences
we see which way the stream of time doth run
and are enforced from our most quiet there
by the rough torrent of occasion
and have the summary of all our griefs
when time shall serve to show in articles
which long ere this we offer to the king
and might by no suit gain our audience
when we are wrong and would unfold our griefs
we are denied access unto his person
even by those men that most have done us wrong
the dangers of the days but newly gone
whose memory is written on the earth
with yet appearing blood and the examples
of every minute instance present now
hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms
not to break peace or any branch of it
but to establish here a peace indeed
concurring both in name and quality


westmoreland

when ever yet was your appeal denied
wherein have you been galled by the king
what peer hath been suborn to grate on you
that you should seal this lawless bloody book
of forged rebellion with a seal divine
and consecrate commotion bitter edge


archbishop of york

my brother general the commonwealth
to brother born an household cruelty
i make my quarrel in particular


westmoreland

there is no need of any such redress
or if there were it not belongs to you


mowbray

why not to him in part and to us all
that feel the bruises of the days before
and suffer the condition of these times
to lay a heavy and unequal hand
upon our honours


westmoreland

o my good lord mowbray
construe the times to their necessities
and you shall say indeed it is the time
and not the king that doth you injuries
yet for your part it not appears to me
either from the king or in the present time
that you should have an inch of any ground
to build a grief on were you not restored
to all the duke of norfolk signories
your noble and right well remember father


mowbray

what thing in honour had my father lost
that need to be revived and breathed in me
the king that loved him as the state stood then
was force perforce compell to banish him
and then that harry bolingbroke and he
being mounted and both roused in their seats
their neighing coursers daring of the spur
their armed staves in charge their beavers down
their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel
and the loud trumpet blowing them together
then then when there was nothing could have stay
my father from the breast of bolingbroke
o when the king did throw his warder down
his own life hung upon the staff he threw
then threw he down himself and all their lives
that by indictment and by dint of sword
have since miscarried under bolingbroke


westmoreland

you speak lord mowbray now you know not what
the earl of hereford was reputed then
in england the most valiant gentlemen
who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled
but if your father had been victor there
he neer had borne it out of coventry
for all the country in a general voice
cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love
were set on hereford whom they doted on
and bless and graced indeed more than the king
but this is mere digression from my purpose
here come i from our princely general
to know your griefs to tell you from his grace
that he will give you audience and wherein
it shall appear that your demands are just
you shall enjoy them every thing set off
that might so much as think you enemies


mowbray

but he hath forced us to compel this offer
and it proceeds from policy not love


westmoreland

mowbray you overween to take it so
this offer comes from mercy not from fear
for lo within a ken our army lies
upon mine honour all too confident
to give admittance to a thought of fear
our battle is more full of names than yours
our men more perfect in the use of arms
our armour all as strong our cause the best
then reason will our heart should be as good
say you not then our offer is compell


mowbray

well by my will we shall admit no parley


westmoreland

that argues but the shame of your offence
a rotten case abides no handling


hastings

hath the prince john a full commission
in very ample virtue of his father
to hear and absolutely to determine
of what conditions we shall stand upon


westmoreland

that is intended in the general name
i muse you make so slight a question


archbishop of york

then take my lord of westmoreland this schedule
for this contains our general grievances
each several article herein redress
all members of our cause both here and hence
that are insinew to this action
acquitted by a true substantial form
and present execution of our wills
to us and to our purposes confined
we come within our awful banks again
and knit our powers to the arm of peace


westmoreland

this will i show the general please you lords
in sight of both our battles we may meet
and either end in peace which god so frame
or to the place of difference call the swords
which must decide it


archbishop of york

my lord we will do so
exit westmoreland


mowbray

there is a thing within my bosom tells me
that no conditions of our peace can stand


hastings

fear you not that if we can make our peace
upon such large terms and so absolute
as our conditions shall consist upon
our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains


mowbray

yea but our valuation shall be such
that every slight and false-derived cause
yea every idle nice and wanton reason
shall to the king taste of this action
that were our royal faiths martyrs in love
we shall be winnow with so rough a wind
that even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
and good from bad find no partition


archbishop of york

no no my lord note this the king is weary
of dainty and such picking grievances
for he hath found to end one doubt by death
revives two greater in the heirs of life
and therefore will he wipe his tables clean
and keep no tell-tale to his memory
that may repeat and history his loss
to new remembrance for full well he knows
he cannot so precisely weed this land
as his misdoubts present occasion
his foes are so enrooted with his friends
that plucking to unfix an enemy
he doth unfasten so and shake a friend
so that this land like an offensive wife
that hath enraged him on to offer strokes
as he is striking holds his infant up
and hangs resolved correction in the arm
that was uprear to execution


hastings

besides the king hath wasted all his rods
on late offenders that he now doth lack
the very instruments of chastisement
so that his power like to a fangless lion
may offer but not hold


archbishop of york

tis very true
and therefore be assured my good lord marshal
if we do now make our atonement well
our peace will like a broken limb united
grow stronger for the breaking


mowbray

be it so
here is return my lord of westmoreland
re-enter westmoreland


westmoreland

the prince is here at hand pleaseth your lordship
to meet his grace just distance tween our armies


mowbray

your grace of york in god name then set forward


archbishop of york

before and greet his grace my lord we come
exeunt

scene ii another part of the forest

enter from one side mowbray attended afterwards  the archbishop of york hastings and others from  the other side prince john of lancaster and westmoreland officers and others with them


lancaster

you are well encounter here my cousin mowbray
good day to you gentle lord archbishop
and so to you lord hastings and to all
my lord of york it better show with you
when that your flock assembled by the bell
encircled you to hear with reverence
your exposition on the holy text
than now to see you here an iron man
cheering a rout of rebels with your drum
turning the word to sword and life to death
that man that sits within a monarch heart
and ripens in the sunshine of his favour
would he abuse the countenance of the king
alack what mischiefs might he set abrooch
in shadow of such greatness with you lord bishop
it is even so who hath not heard it spoken
how deep you were within the books of god
to us the speaker in his parliament
to us the imagined voice of god himself
the very opener and intelligencer
between the grace the sanctities of heaven
and our dull workings o who shall believe
but you misuse the reverence of your place
employ the countenance and grace of heaven
as a false favourite doth his prince name
in deeds dishonourable you have taen up
under the counterfeited zeal of god
the subjects of his substitute my father
and both against the peace of heaven and him
have here up-swarm them


archbishop of york

good my lord of lancaster
i am not here against your father peace
but as i told my lord of westmoreland
the time misorder doth in common sense
crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form
to hold our safety up i sent your grace
the parcels and particulars of our grief
the which hath been with scorn shoved from the court
whereon this hydra son of war is born
whose dangerous eyes may well be charm asleep
with grant of our most just and right desires
and true obedience of this madness cured
stoop tamely to the foot of majesty


mowbray

if not we ready are to try our fortunes
to the last man


hastings

and though we here fall down
we have supplies to second our attempt
if they miscarry theirs shall second them
and so success of mischief shall be born
and heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
whiles england shall have generation


lancaster

you are too shallow hastings much too shallow
to sound the bottom of the after-times


westmoreland

pleaseth your grace to answer them directly
how far forth you do like their articles


lancaster

i like them all and do allow them well
and swear here by the honour of my blood
my father purposes have been mistook
and some about him have too lavishly
wrested his meaning and authority
my lord these griefs shall be with speed redress
upon my soul they shall if this may please you
discharge your powers unto their several counties
as we will ours and here between the armies
let drink together friendly and embrace
that all their eyes may bear those tokens home
of our restored love and amity


archbishop of york

i take your princely word for these redresses


lancaster

i give it you and will maintain my word
and thereupon i drink unto your grace


hastings

go captain and deliver to the army
this news of peace let them have pay and part
i know it will well please them hie thee captain
exit officer


archbishop of york

to you my noble lord of westmoreland


westmoreland

i pledge your grace and if you knew what pains
i have bestow to breed this present peace
you would drink freely but my love to ye
shall show itself more openly hereafter


archbishop of york

i do not doubt you


westmoreland

i am glad of it
health to my lord and gentle cousin mowbray


mowbray

you wish me health in very happy season
for i am on the sudden something ill


archbishop of york

against ill chances men are ever merry
but heaviness foreruns the good event


westmoreland

therefore be merry coz since sudden sorrow
serves to say thus ome good thing comes
to-morrow


archbishop of york

believe me i am passing light in spirit


mowbray

so much the worse if your own rule be true
shouts within


lancaster

the word of peace is render hark how they shout


mowbray

this had been cheerful after victory


archbishop of york

a peace is of the nature of a conquest
for then both parties nobly are subdued
and neither party loser


lancaster

go my lord
and let our army be discharged too
exit westmoreland
and good my lord so please you let our trains
march by us that we may peruse the men
we should have coped withal


archbishop of york

go good lord hastings
and ere they be dismissed let them march by
exit hastings


lancaster

i trust lords we shall lie to-night together
re-enter westmoreland

westmoreland

will not go off until they hear you speak


lancaster

hastings

like youthful steers unyoked they take their courses
east west north south or like a school broke up
each hurries toward his home and sporting-place


westmoreland

i do arrest thee traitor of high treason
and you lord archbishop and you lord mowbray
of capitol treason i attach you both


mowbray

is this proceeding just and honourable


westmoreland

is your assembly so


archbishop of york

will you thus break your faith


lancaster

i pawn thee none
i promised you redress of these same grievances
whereof you did complain which by mine honour
i will perform with a most christian care
but for you rebels look to taste the due
meet for rebellion and such acts as yours
most shallowly did you these arms commence
fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence
strike up our drums pursue the scatter stray

of valour do you think me a swallow an arrow or a
bullet have i in my poor and old motion the
expedition of thought i have speeded hither with
the very extremest inch of possibility i have
foundered nine score and odd posts and here
travel-tainted as i am have in my pure and
immaculate valour taken sir john colevile of the
dale a most furious knight and valorous enemy
but what of that he saw me and yielded that i
may justly say with the hook-nosed fellow of rome
i came saw and overcame


lancaster

it was more of his courtesy than your deserving


falstaff

i know not here he is and here i yield him and
i beseech your grace let it be booked with the
rest of this day deeds or by the lord i will
have it in a particular ballad else with mine own
picture on the top ont colevile kissing my foot
to the which course if i be enforced if you do not
all show like gilt twopences to me and i in the
clear sky of fame oershine you as much as the full
moon doth the cinders of the element which show
like pins heads to her believe not the word of
the noble therefore let me have right and let
desert mount

through gloucestershire and when you come to court
stand my good lord pray in your good report


lancaster

fare you well falstaff i in my condition
shall better speak of you than you deserve
exeunt all but falstaff


falstaff

i would you had but the wit twere better than
your dukedom good faith this same young sober-
blooded boy doth not love me nor a man cannot make
him laugh but that no marvel he drinks no wine
there never none of these demure boys come to any
proof for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood
and making many fish-meals that they fall into a
kind of male green-sickness and then when they
marry they get wenches they are generally fools
and cowards which some of us should be too but for
inflammation a good sherris sack hath a two-fold
operation in it it ascends me into the brain
dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy
vapours which environ it makes it apprehensive
quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and
delectable shapes which delivered oer to the
voice the tongue which is the birth becomes
excellent wit the second property of your
excellent sherris is the warming of the blood
which before cold and settled left the liver
white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity
and cowardice but the sherris warms it and makes
it course from the inwards to the parts extreme
it illumineth the face which as a beacon gives
warning to all the rest of this little kingdom
man to arm and then the vital commoners and
inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain
the heart who great and puffed up with this
retinue doth any deed of courage and this valour
comes of sherris so that skill in the weapon is
nothing without sack for that sets it a-work and
learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till
sack commences it and sets it in act and use
hereof comes it that prince harry is valiant for
the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his
father he hath like lean sterile and bare land
manured husbanded and tilled with excellent
endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile
sherris that he is become very hot and valiant if
i had a thousand sons the first humane principle i
would teach them should be to forswear thin
potations and to addict themselves to sack

scene iv westminster the jerusalem chamber

enter king henry iv the princes thomas of clarence and humphrey of gloucester warwick and others


king henry iv

now lords if god doth give successful end
to this debate that bleedeth at our doors
we will our youth lead on to higher fields
and draw no swords but what are sanctified
our navy is address our power collected
our substitutes in absence well invested
and every thing lies level to our wish
only we want a little personal strength
and pause us till these rebels now afoot
come underneath the yoke of government


warwick

both which we doubt not but your majesty
shall soon enjoy


king henry iv

humphrey my son of gloucester
where is the prince your brother


gloucester

i think he gone to hunt my lord at windsor


king henry iv

and how accompanied


gloucester

i do not know my lord


king henry iv

is not his brother thomas of clarence with him


gloucester

no my good lord he is in presence here


clarence

what would my lord and father


king henry iv

nothing but well to thee thomas of clarence
how chance thou art not with the prince thy brother
he loves thee and thou dost neglect him thomas
thou hast a better place in his affection
than all thy brothers cherish it my boy
and noble offices thou mayst effect
of mediation after i am dead
between his greatness and thy other brethren
therefore omit him not blunt not his love
nor lose the good advantage of his grace
by seeming cold or careless of his will
for he is gracious if he be observed
he hath a tear for pity and a hand
open as day for melting charity
yet notwithstanding being incensed he flint
as humorous as winter and as sudden
as flaws congealed in the spring of day
his temper therefore must be well observed
chide him for faults and do it reverently
when thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth
but being moody give him line and scope
till that his passions like a whale on ground
confound themselves with working learn this thomas
and thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends
a hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in
that the united vessel of their blood
mingled with venom of suggestion 
as force perforce the age will pour it in 
shall never leak though it do work as strong
as aconitum or rash gunpowder


clarence

i shall observe him with all care and love


king henry iv

why art thou not at windsor with him thomas


clarence

he is not there to-day he dines in london


king henry iv

and how accompanied canst thou tell that


clarence

with poins and other his continual followers


king henry iv

most subject is the fattest soil to weeds
and he the noble image of my youth
is overspread with them therefore my grief
stretches itself beyond the hour of death
the blood weeps from my heart when i do shape
in forms imaginary the unguided days
and rotten times that you shall look upon
when i am sleeping with my ancestors
for when his headstrong riot hath no curb
when rage and hot blood are his counsellors
when means and lavish manners meet together
o with what wings shall his affections fly
towards fronting peril and opposed decay


warwick

my gracious lord you look beyond him quite
the prince but studies his companions
like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language
tis needful that the most immodest word
be look upon and learn which once attain
your highness knows comes to no further use
but to be known and hated so like gross terms
the prince will in the perfectness of time
cast off his followers and their memory
shall as a pattern or a measure live
by which his grace must mete the lives of others
turning past evils to advantages


king henry iv

tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb
in the dead carrion

are brought to the correction of your law
there is not now a rebel sword unsheath
but peace puts forth her olive every where
the manner how this action hath been borne
here at more leisure may your highness read
with every course in his particular

o westmoreland thou art a summer bird
which ever in the haunch of winter sings
the lifting up of day
enter harcourt

harcourt

from enemies heaven keep your majesty
and when they stand against you may they fall
as those that i am come to tell you of
the earl northumberland and the lord bardolph
with a great power of english and of scots
are by the sheriff of yorkshire overthrown
the manner and true order of the fight
this packet please it you contains at large


king henry iv

and wherefore should these good news make me sick
will fortune never come with both hands full
but write her fair words still in foulest letters
she either gives a stomach and no food
such are the poor in health or else a feast
and takes away the stomach such are the rich
that have abundance and enjoy it not
i should rejoice now at this happy news
and now my sight fails and my brain is giddy
o me come near me now i am much ill

clarence

the incessant care and labour of his mind
hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
so thin that life looks through and will break out


gloucester

the people fear me for they do observe
unfather heirs and loathly births of nature
the seasons change their manners as the year
had found some months asleep and leap them over


clarence

say it did so a little time before
that our great-grandsire edward sick and died

clarence

let us withdraw into the other room


warwick

willt please your grace to go along with us


prince henry

no i will sit and watch here by the king
exeunt all but prince henry
why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow
being so troublesome a bedfellow
o polish perturbation golden care
that keep the ports of slumber open wide
to many a watchful night sleep with it now
yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet
as he whose brow with homely biggen bound
snores out the watch of night o majesty
when thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit
like a rich armour worn in heat of day
that scalds with safety by his gates of breath
there lies a downy feather which stirs not
did he suspire that light and weightless down
perforce must move my gracious lord my father
this sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep
that from this golden rigol hath divorced
so many english kings thy due from me
is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood
which nature love and filial tenderness
shall o dear father pay thee plenteously
my due from thee is this imperial crown
which as immediate as thy place and blood
derives itself to me lo here it sits
which god shall guard and put the world whole strength
into one giant arm it shall not force
this lineal honour from me this from thee
will i to mine leave as tis left to me

my sleep my death
find him my lord of warwick chide him hither
exit warwick
this part of his conjoins with my disease
and helps to end me see sons what things you are
how quickly nature falls into revolt
when gold becomes her object
for this the foolish over-careful fathers
have broke their sleep with thoughts their brains with care
their bones with industry
for this they have engrossed and piled up
the canker heaps of strange-achieved gold
for this they have been thoughtful to invest
their sons with arts and martial exercises
when like the bee culling from every flower
the virtuous sweets
our thighs pack with wax our mouths with honey
we bring it to the hive and like the bees
are murdered for our pains this bitter taste
yield his engrossments to the ending father
re-enter warwick
now where is he that will not stay so long
till his friend sickness hath determined me


warwick

my lord i found the prince in the next room
washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks
with such a deep demeanor in great sorrow
that tyranny which never quaff but blood
would by beholding him have wash his knife
with gentle eye-drops he is coming hither


king henry iv

but wherefore did he take away the crown
re-enter prince henry
lo where he comes come hither to me harry
depart the chamber leave us here alone
exeunt warwick and the rest


prince henry

i never thought to hear you speak again


king henry iv

thy wish was father harry to that thought
i stay too long by thee i weary thee
dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair
that thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours
before thy hour be ripe o foolish youth
thou seek the greatness that will oerwhelm thee
stay but a little for my cloud of dignity
is held from falling with so weak a wind
that it will quickly drop my day is dim
thou hast stolen that which after some few hours
were thine without offence and at my death
thou hast seal up my expectation
thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not
and thou wilt have me die assured of it
thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts
which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart
to stab at half an hour of my life
what canst thou not forbear me half an hour
then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself
and bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
that thou art crowned not that i am dead
let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
be drops of balm to sanctify thy head
only compound me with forgotten dust
give that which gave thee life unto the worms
pluck down my officers break my decrees
for now a time is come to mock at form
harry the fifth is crown up vanity
down royal state all you sage counsellors hence
and to the english court assemble now
from every region apes of idleness
now neighbour confines purge you of your scum
have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance
revel the night rob murder and commit
the oldest sins the newest kind of ways
be happy he will trouble you no more
england shall double gild his treble guilt
england shall give him office honour might
for the fifth harry from curb licence plucks
the muzzle of restraint and the wild dog
shall flesh his tooth on every innocent
o my poor kingdom sick with civil blows
when that my care could not withhold thy riots
what wilt thou do when riot is thy care
o thou wilt be a wilderness again
peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants


prince henry

o pardon me my liege but for my tears
the moist impediments unto my speech
i had forestall this dear and deep rebuke
ere you with grief had spoke and i had heard
the course of it so far there is your crown
and he that wears the crown immortally
long guard it yours if i affect it more
than as your honour and as your renown
let me no more from this obedience rise
which my most inward true and duteous spirit
teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending
god witness with me when i here came in
and found no course of breath within your majesty
how cold it struck my heart if i do feign
o let me in my present wildness die
and never live to show the incredulous world
the noble change that i have purposed
coming to look on you thinking you dead
and dead almost my liege to think you were
i spake unto this crown as having sense
and thus upbraided it the care on thee depending
hath fed upon the body of my father
therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold
other less fine in carat is more precious
preserving life in medicine potable
but thou most fine most honour most renown
hast eat thy bearer up thus my most royal liege
accusing it i put it on my head
to try with it as with an enemy
that had before my face murder my father
the quarrel of a true inheritor
but if it did infect my blood with joy
or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride
if any rebel or vain spirit of mine
did with the least affection of a welcome
give entertainment to the might of it
let god for ever keep it from my head
and make me as the poorest vassal is
that doth with awe and terror kneel to it


king henry iv

o my son
god put it in thy mind to take it hence
that thou mightst win the more thy father love
pleading so wisely in excuse of it
come hither harry sit thou by my bed
and hear i think the very latest counsel
that ever i shall breathe god knows my son
by what by-paths and indirect crook ways
i met this crown and i myself know well
how troublesome it sat upon my head
to thee it shall descend with bitter quiet
better opinion better confirmation
for all the soil of the achievement goes
with me into the earth it seem in me
but as an honour snatch with boisterous hand
and i had many living to upbraid
my gain of it by their assistances
which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed
wounding supposed peace all these bold fears
thou see with peril i have answered
for all my reign hath been but as a scene
acting that argument and now my death
changes the mode for what in me was purchased
falls upon thee in a more fairer sort
so thou the garland wear successively
yet though thou stand more sure than i could do
thou art not firm enough since griefs are green
and all my friends which thou must make thy friends
have but their stings and teeth newly taen out
by whose fell working i was first advanced
and by whose power i well might lodge a fear
to be again displaced which to avoid
i cut them off and had a purpose now
to lead out many to the holy land
lest rest and lying still might make them look
too near unto my state therefore my harry
be it thy course to busy giddy minds
with foreign quarrels that action hence borne out
may waste the memory of the former days
more would i but my lungs are wasted so
that strength of speech is utterly denied me
how i came by the crown o god forgive
and grant it may with thee in true peace live


prince henry

my gracious liege
you won it wore it kept it gave it me
then plain and right must my possession be
which i with more than with a common pain
gainst all the world will rightfully maintain
enter lord john of lancaster


king henry iv

that visor is an arrant knave on my knowledge

yet god forbid sir but a knave should have some
countenance at his friend request an honest
man sir is able to speak for himself when a knave
is not i have served your worship truly sir
this eight years and if i cannot once or twice in
a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man i

if i were sawed into quantities i should make four
dozen of such bearded hermits staves as master
shallow it is a wonderful thing to see the
semblable coherence of his men spirits and his
they by observing of him do bear themselves like
foolish justices he by conversing with them is
turned into a justice-like serving-man their
spirits are so married in conjunction with the
participation of society that they flock together in
consent like so many wild-geese if i had a suit
to master shallow i would humour his men with the
imputation of being near their master if to his
men i would curry with master shallow that no man
could better command his servants it is certain
that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is
caught as men take diseases one of another
therefore let men take heed of their company i
will devise matter enough out of this shallow to
keep prince harry in continual laughter the wearing
out of six fashions which is four terms or two
actions and a shall laugh without intervallums o
it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest
with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never
had the ache in his shoulders o you shall see him

good morrow cousin warwick good morrow

warwick

we do remember but our argument
is all too heavy to admit much talk


lancaster

well peace be with him that hath made us heavy
lord chief-justicepeace be with us lest we be heavier


gloucester

o good my lord you have lost a friend indeed
and i dare swear you borrow not that face
of seeming sorrow it is sure your own


lancaster

though no man be assured what grace to find
you stand in coldest expectation
i am the sorrier would twere otherwise


clarence

well you must now speak sir john falstaff fair
which swims against your stream of quality
lord chief-justicesweet princes what i did i did in honour
led by the impartial conduct of my soul
and never shall you see that i will beg
a ragged and forestall remission
if truth and upright innocency fail me
ill to the king my master that is dead
and tell him who hath sent me after him


warwick

here comes the prince
enter king henry v attended
lord chief-justicegood morrow and god save your majesty


king henry v

this new and gorgeous garment majesty
sits not so easy on me as you think
brothers you mix your sadness with some fear
this is the english not the turkish court
not amurath an amurath succeeds
but harry harry yet be sad good brothers
for by my faith it very well becomes you
sorrow so royally in you appears
that i will deeply put the fashion on
and wear it in my heart why then be sad
but entertain no more of it good brothers
than a joint burden laid upon us all
for me by heaven i bid you be assured
ill be your father and your brother too
let me but bear your love i ll bear your cares
yet weep that harry dead and so will i
but harry lives that shall convert those tears
by number into hours of happiness


princes

we hope no other from your majesty


king henry v

you all look strangely on me and you most
you are i think assured i love you not
lord chief-justicei am assured if i be measured rightly
your majesty hath no just cause to hate me


king henry v

no
how might a prince of my great hopes forget
so great indignities you laid upon me
what rate rebuke and roughly send to prison
the immediate heir of england was this easy
may this be wash in lethe and forgotten
lord chief-justicei then did use the person of your father
the image of his power lay then in me
and in the administration of his law
whiles i was busy for the commonwealth
your highness pleased to forget my place
the majesty and power of law and justice
the image of the king whom i presented
and struck me in my very seat of judgment
whereon as an offender to your father
i gave bold way to my authority
and did commit you if the deed were ill
be you contented wearing now the garland
to have a son set your decrees at nought
to pluck down justice from your awful bench
to trip the course of law and blunt the sword
that guards the peace and safety of your person
nay more to spurn at your most royal image
and mock your workings in a second body
question your royal thoughts make the case yours
be now the father and propose a son
hear your own dignity so much profaned
see your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted
behold yourself so by a son disdain
and then imagine me taking your part
and in your power soft silencing your son
after this cold considerance sentence me
and as you are a king speak in your state
what i have done that misbecame my place
my person or my liege sovereignty


king henry v

you are right justice and you weigh this well
therefore still bear the balance and the sword
and i do wish your honours may increase
till you do live to see a son of mine
offend you and obey you as i did
so shall i live to speak my father words
happy am i that have a man so bold
that dares do justice on my proper son
and not less happy having such a son
that would deliver up his greatness so
into the hands of justice you did commit me
for which i do commit into your hand
the unstained sword that you have used to bear
with this remembrance that you use the same
with the like bold just and impartial spirit
as you have done gainst me there is my hand
you shall be as a father to my youth
my voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear
and i will stoop and humble my intents
to your well-practised wise directions
and princes all believe me i beseech you
my father is gone wild into his grave
for in his tomb lie my affections
and with his spirit sadly i survive
to mock the expectation of the world
to frustrate prophecies and to raze out
rotten opinion who hath writ me down
after my seeming the tide of blood in me
hath proudly flow in vanity till now
now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea
where it shall mingle with the state of floods
and flow henceforth in formal majesty
now call we our high court of parliament
and let us choose such limbs of noble counsel
that the great body of our state may go
in equal rank with the best govern nation
that war or peace or both at once may be
as things acquainted and familiar to us
in which you father shall have foremost hand
our coronation done we will accite
as i before remember all our state
and god consigning to my good intents
no prince nor peer shall have just cause to say
god shorten harry happy life one day

epilogue
spoken by a dancer
first my fear then my courtesy last my speech
my fear is your displeasure my courtesy my duty
and my speech to beg your pardons if you look
for a good speech now you undo me for what i have
to say is of mine own making and what indeed i
should say will i doubt prove mine own marring
but to the purpose and so to the venture be it
known to you as it is very well i was lately here
in the end of a displeasing play to pray your
patience for it and to promise you a better i
meant indeed to pay you with this which if like an
ill venture it come unluckily home i break and
you my gentle creditors lose here i promised you
i would be and here i commit my body to your
mercies bate me some and i will pay you some and
as most debtors do promise you infinitely
if my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me will
you command me to use my legs and yet that were but
light payment to dance out of your debt but a
good conscience will make any possible satisfaction
and so would i all the gentlewomen here have
forgiven me if the gentlemen will not then the
gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen which
was never seen before in such an assembly
one word more i beseech you if you be not too
much cloyed with fat meat our humble author will
continue the story with sir john in it and make
you merry with fair katharine of france where for
any thing i know falstaff shall die of a sweat
unless already a be killed with your hard
opinions for oldcastle died a martyr and this is
not the man my tongue is weary when my legs are
too i will bid you good night and so kneel down
before you but indeed to pray for the queen
the second part of king henry the sixth

act i
scene i london the palace

flourish of trumpets then hautboys enter king  henry vi gloucester salisbury warwick and  cardinal on the one side queen margaret suffolk york somerset and buckingham on the other


suffolk

as by your high imperial majesty
i had in charge at my depart for france
as procurator to your excellence
to marry princess margaret for your grace
so in the famous ancient city tours
in presence of the kings of france and sicil
the dukes of orleans calaber bretagne and alencon
seven earls twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops
i have perform my task and was espoused
and humbly now upon my bended knee
in sight of england and her lordly peers
deliver up my title in the queen
to your most gracious hands that are the substance
of that great shadow i did represent
the happiest gift that ever marquess gave
the fairest queen that ever king received


king henry vi

suffolk arise welcome queen margaret
i can express no kinder sign of love
than this kind kiss o lord that lends me life
lend me a heart replete with thankfulness
for thou hast given me in this beauteous face
a world of earthly blessings to my soul
if sympathy of love unite our thoughts


queen margaret

great king of england and my gracious lord
the mutual conference that my mind hath had
by day by night waking and in my dreams
in courtly company or at my beads
with you mine alder-liefest sovereign
makes me the bolder to salute my king
with ruder terms such as my wit affords
and over-joy of heart doth minister


king henry vi

her sight did ravish but her grace in speech
her words y-clad with wisdom majesty
makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys
such is the fulness of my heart content
lords with one cheerful voice welcome my love


all

kneeling  long live queen margaret england
happiness


queen margaret

we thank you all
flourish


suffolk

my lord protector so it please your grace
here are the articles of contracted peace
between our sovereign and the french king charles
for eighteen months concluded by consent


gloucester

reads  imprimis it is agreed between the french
king charles and william de la pole marquess of
suffolk ambassador for henry king of england that
the said henry shall espouse the lady margaret
daughter unto reignier king of naples sicilia and
jerusalem and crown her queen of england ere the
thirtieth of may next ensuing item that the duchy
of anjou and the county of maine shall be released
and delivered to the king her father 
lets the paper fall


king henry vi

uncle how now


gloucester

pardon me gracious lord
some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart
and dimm mine eyes that i can read no further


king henry vi

uncle of winchester i pray read on


cardinal

reads  item it is further agreed between them
that the duchies of anjou and maine shall be
released and delivered over to the king her father
and she sent over of the king of england own
proper cost and charges without having any dowry


king henry vi

they please us well lord marquess kneel down
we here create thee the first duke of suffolk
and gird thee with the sword cousin of york
we here discharge your grace from being regent
i the parts of france till term of eighteen months
be full expired thanks uncle winchester
gloucester york buckingham somerset
salisbury and warwick
we thank you all for the great favour done
in entertainment to my princely queen
come let us in and with all speed provide
to see her coronation be perform
exeunt king henry vi queen margaret and suffolk


gloucester

brave peers of england pillars of the state
to you duke humphrey must unload his grief
your grief the common grief of all the land
what did my brother henry spend his youth
his valour coin and people in the wars
did he so often lodge in open field
in winter cold and summer parching heat
to conquer france his true inheritance
and did my brother bedford toil his wits
to keep by policy what henry got
have you yourselves somerset buckingham
brave york salisbury and victorious warwick
received deep scars in france and normandy
or hath mine uncle beaufort and myself
with all the learned council of the realm
studied so long sat in the council-house
early and late debating to and fro
how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe
and had his highness in his infancy
crowned in paris in despite of foes
and shall these labours and these honours die
shall henry conquest bedford vigilance
your deeds of war and all our counsel die
o peers of england shameful is this league
fatal this marriage cancelling your fame
blotting your names from books of memory
razing the characters of your renown
defacing monuments of conquer france
undoing all as all had never been


cardinal

nephew what means this passionate discourse
this peroration with such circumstance
for france tis ours and we will keep it still


gloucester

ay uncle we will keep it if we can
but now it is impossible we should
suffolk the new-made duke that rules the roast
hath given the duchy of anjou and maine
unto the poor king reignier whose large style
agrees not with the leanness of his purse


salisbury

now by the death of him that died for all
these counties were the keys of normandy
but wherefore weeps warwick my valiant son


warwick

for grief that they are past recovery
for were there hope to conquer them again
my sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears
anjou and maine myself did win them both
those provinces these arms of mine did conquer
and are the cities that i got with wounds
delivered up again with peaceful words
mort dieu


york

for suffolk duke may he be suffocate
that dims the honour of this warlike isle
france should have torn and rent my very heart
before i would have yielded to this league
i never read but england kings have had
large sums of gold and dowries with their wives
and our king henry gives away his own
to match with her that brings no vantages


gloucester

a proper jest and never heard before
that suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
for costs and charges in transporting her
she should have stayed in france and starved
in france before 


cardinal

my lord of gloucester now ye grow too hot
it was the pleasure of my lord the king


gloucester

my lord of winchester i know your mind
tis not my speeches that you do mislike
but tis my presence that doth trouble ye
rancour will out proud prelate in thy face
i see thy fury if i longer stay
we shall begin our ancient bickerings
lordings farewell and say when i am gone
i prophesied france will be lost ere long
exit


cardinal

so there goes our protector in a rage
tis known to you he is mine enemy
nay more an enemy unto you all
and no great friend i fear me to the king
consider lords he is the next of blood
and heir apparent to the english crown
had henry got an empire by his marriage
and all the wealthy kingdoms of the west
there reason he should be displeased at it
look to it lords let not his smoothing words
bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect
what though the common people favour him
calling him humphrey the good duke of
gloucester
clapping their hands and crying with loud voice
jesu maintain your royal excellence
with god preserve the good duke humphrey
i fear me lords for all this flattering gloss
he will be found a dangerous protector


buckingham

why should he then protect our sovereign
he being of age to govern of himself
cousin of somerset join you with me
and all together with the duke of suffolk
well quickly hoise duke humphrey from his seat


cardinal

this weighty business will not brook delay
ill to the duke of suffolk presently
exit


somerset

cousin of buckingham though humphrey pride
and greatness of his place be grief to us
yet let us watch the haughty cardinal
his insolence is more intolerable
than all the princes in the land beside
if gloucester be displaced hell be protector


buckingham

or thou or i somerset will be protector
despite duke humphrey or the cardinal
exeunt buckingham and somerset


salisbury

pride went before ambition follows him
while these do labour for their own preferment
behoves it us to labour for the realm
i never saw but humphrey duke of gloucester
did bear him like a noble gentleman
oft have i seen the haughty cardinal
more like a soldier than a man o the church
as stout and proud as he were lord of all
swear like a ruffian and demean himself
unlike the ruler of a commonweal
warwick my son the comfort of my age
thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping
hath won the greatest favour of the commons
excepting none but good duke humphrey
and brother york thy acts in ireland
in bringing them to civil discipline
thy late exploits done in the heart of france
when thou wert regent for our sovereign
have made thee fear and honour of the people
join we together for the public good
in what we can to bridle and suppress
the pride of suffolk and the cardinal
with somerset and buckingham ambition
and as we may cherish duke humphrey deeds
while they do tend the profit of the land


warwick

so god help warwick as he loves the land
and common profit of his country


york

aside  and so says york for he hath greatest cause


salisbury

then let make haste away and look unto the main


warwick

unto the main o father maine is lost
that maine which by main force warwick did win
and would have kept so long as breath did last
main chance father you meant but i meant maine
which i will win from france or else be slain
exeunt warwick and salisbury


york

anjou and maine are given to the french
paris is lost the state of normandy
stands on a tickle point now they are gone
suffolk concluded on the articles
the peers agreed and henry was well pleased
to change two dukedoms for a duke fair daughter
i cannot blame them all what ist to them
tis thine they give away and not their own
pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
and purchase friends and give to courtezans
still revelling like lords till all be gone
while as the silly owner of the goods
weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof
while all is shared and all is borne away
ready to starve and dare not touch his own
so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue
while his own lands are bargain for and sold
methinks the realms of england france and ireland
bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
as did the fatal brand althaea burn
unto the prince heart of calydon
anjou and maine both given unto the french
cold news for me for i had hope of france
even as i have of fertile england soil
a day will come when york shall claim his own
and therefore i will take the nevils parts
and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey
and when i spy advantage claim the crown
for that the golden mark i seek to hit
nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right
nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist
nor wear the diadem upon his head
whose church-like humours fits not for a crown
then york be still awhile till time do serve
watch thou and wake when others be asleep
to pry into the secrets of the state
till henry surfeiting in joys of love
with his new bride and england dear-bought queen
and humphrey with the peers be falln at jars
then will i raise aloft the milk-white rose
with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed
and in my standard bear the arms of york
to grapple with the house of lancaster
and force perforce ill make him yield the crown
whose bookish rule hath pull fair england down
exit

scene ii gloucester house

enter gloucester and his duchess


duchess

why droops my lord like over-ripen corn
hanging the head at ceres plenteous load
why doth the great duke humphrey knit his brows
as frowning at the favours of the world
why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth
gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight
what seest thou there king henry diadem
enchased with all the honours of the world
if so gaze on and grovel on thy face
until thy head be circled with the same
put forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold
what ist too short ill lengthen it with mine
and having both together heaved it up
well both together lift our heads to heaven
and never more abase our sight so low
as to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground


gloucester

o nell sweet nell if thou dost love thy lord
banish the canker of ambitious thoughts
and may that thought when i imagine ill
against my king and nephew virtuous henry
be my last breathing in this mortal world
my troublous dream this night doth make me sad


duchess

what dream my lord tell me and ill requite it
with sweet rehearsal of my morning dream


gloucester

methought this staff mine office-badge in court
was broke in twain by whom i have forgot
but as i think it was by the cardinal
and on the pieces of the broken wand
were placed the heads of edmund duke of somerset
and william de la pole first duke of suffolk
this was my dream what it doth bode god knows


duchess

tut this was nothing but an argument
that he that breaks a stick of gloucester grove
shall lose his head for his presumption
but list to me my humphrey my sweet duke
methought i sat in seat of majesty
in the cathedral church of westminster
and in that chair where kings and queens are crown
where henry and dame margaret kneel to me
and on my head did set the diadem


gloucester

nay eleanor then must i chide outright
presumptuous dame ill-nurtured eleanor
art thou not second woman in the realm
and the protector wife beloved of him
hast thou not worldly pleasure at command
above the reach or compass of thy thought
and wilt thou still be hammering treachery
to tumble down thy husband and thyself
from top of honour to disgrace feet
away from me and let me hear no more


duchess

what what my lord are you so choleric
with eleanor for telling but her dream
next time ill keep my dreams unto myself
and not be cheque


gloucester

nay be not angry i am pleased again
enter messenger


messenger

my lord protector tis his highness pleasure
you do prepare to ride unto saint alban
where as the king and queen do mean to hawk


gloucester

i go come nell thou wilt ride with us


duchess

yes my good lord ill follow presently
exeunt gloucester and messenger
follow i must i cannot go before
while gloucester bears this base and humble mind
were i a man a duke and next of blood
i would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks
and smooth my way upon their headless necks
and being a woman i will not be slack
to play my part in fortune pageant
where are you there sir john nay fear not man
we are alone here none but thee and i
enter hume


hume

jesus preserve your royal majesty


duchess

what say thou majesty i am but grace


hume

but by the grace of god and hume advice

duchess

what say thou man hast thou as yet conferr
with margery jourdain the cunning witch
with roger bolingbroke the conjurer
and will they undertake to do me good


hume

this they have promised to show your highness
a spirit raised from depth of under-ground
that shall make answer to such questions
as by your grace shall be propounded him


duchess

it is enough ill think upon the questions
when from st alban we do make return
well see these things effected to the full
here hume take this reward make merry man
with thy confederates in this weighty cause
exit


hume

hume must make merry with the duchess gold
marry and shall but how now sir john hume
seal up your lips and give no words but mum
the business asketh silent secrecy
dame eleanor gives gold to bring the witch
gold cannot come amiss were she a devil
yet have i gold flies from another coast
i dare not say from the rich cardinal
and from the great and new-made duke of suffolk
yet i do find it so for to be plain
they knowing dame eleanor aspiring humour
have hired me to undermine the duchess
and buz these conjurations in her brain
they say a crafty knave does need no broker
yet am i suffolk and the cardinal broker
hume if you take not heed you shall go near
to call them both a pair of crafty knaves
well so it stands and thus i fear at last
hume knavery will be the duchess wreck
and her attainture will be humphrey fall
sort how it will i shall have gold for all

peter

horner for saying that the duke of york was rightful
heir to the crown


queen margaret

what sayst thou did the duke of york say he was
rightful heir to the crown


peter

queen margaret

and as for you that love to be protected
under the wings of our protector grace
begin your suits anew and sue to him
tears the supplication
away base cullions suffolk let them go


all

come let be gone
exeunt


queen margaret

my lord of suffolk say is this the guise
is this the fashion in the court of england
is this the government of britain isle
and this the royalty of albion king
what shall king henry be a pupil still
under the surly gloucester governance
am i a queen in title and in style
and must be made a subject to a duke
i tell thee pole when in the city tours
thou ran a tilt in honour of my love
and stolest away the ladies hearts of france
i thought king henry had resembled thee
in courage courtship and proportion
but all his mind is bent to holiness
to number ave-maries on his beads
his champions are the prophets and apostles
his weapons holy saws of sacred writ
his study is his tilt-yard and his loves
are brazen images of canonized saints
i would the college of the cardinals
would choose him pope and carry him to rome
and set the triple crown upon his head
that were a state fit for his holiness


suffolk

madam be patient as i was cause
your highness came to england so will i
in england work your grace full content


queen margaret

beside the haughty protector have we beaufort
the imperious churchman somerset buckingham
and grumbling york and not the least of these
but can do more in england than the king


suffolk

and he of these that can do most of all
cannot do more in england than the nevils
salisbury and warwick are no simple peers


queen margaret

not all these lords do vex me half so much
as that proud dame the lord protector wife
she sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies
more like an empress than duke humphrey wife
strangers in court do take her for the queen
she bears a duke revenues on her back
and in her heart she scorns our poverty
shall i not live to be avenged on her
contemptuous base-born callet as she is
she vaunted mongst her minions tother day
the very train of her worst wearing gown
was better worth than all my father lands
till suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter


suffolk

madam myself have limed a bush for her
and placed a quire of such enticing birds
that she will light to listen to the lays
and never mount to trouble you again
so let her rest and madam list to me
for i am bold to counsel you in this
although we fancy not the cardinal
yet must we join with him and with the lords
till we have brought duke humphrey in disgrace
as for the duke of york this late complaint
will make but little for his benefit
so one by one well weed them all at last
and you yourself shall steer the happy helm
sound a sennet enter king henry vi gloucester  cardinal buckingham york somerset salisbury warwick and the duchess


king henry vi

for my part noble lords i care not which
or somerset or york all one to me


york

if york have ill demean himself in france
then let him be denay the regentship


somerset

if somerset be unworthy of the place
let york be regent i will yield to him


warwick

whether your grace be worthy yea or no
dispute not that york is the worthier


cardinal

ambitious warwick let thy betters speak


warwick

the cardinal not my better in the field


buckingham

all in this presence are thy betters warwick


warwick

warwick may live to be the best of all


salisbury

peace son and show some reason buckingham
why somerset should be preferred in this


queen margaret

because the king forsooth will have it so


gloucester

madam the king is old enough himself
to give his censure these are no women matters


queen margaret

if he be old enough what needs your grace
to be protector of his excellence


gloucester

madam i am protector of the realm
and at his pleasure will resign my place


suffolk

resign it then and leave thine insolence
since thou wert king as who is king but thou 
the commonwealth hath daily run to wreck
the dauphin hath prevail beyond the seas
and all the peers and nobles of the realm
have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty


cardinal

the commons hast thou rack the clergy bags
are lank and lean with thy extortions


somerset

thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife attire
have cost a mass of public treasury


buckingham

thy cruelty in execution
upon offenders hath exceeded law
and left thee to the mercy of the law


queen margaret

they sale of offices and towns in france
if they were known as the suspect is great
would make thee quickly hop without thy head
exit gloucester queen margaret drops her fan
give me my fan what minion can ye not
she gives the duchess a box on the ear
i cry you mercy madam was it you


duchess

wast i yea i it was proud frenchwoman
could i come near your beauty with my nails
i set my ten commandments in your face


king henry vi

sweet aunt be quiet twas against her will


duchess

against her will good king look tot in time
shell hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby
though in this place most master wear no breeches
she shall not strike dame eleanor unrevenged
exit


buckingham

lord cardinal i will follow eleanor
and listen after humphrey how he proceeds
she tickled now her fume needs no spurs
shell gallop far enough to her destruction
exit
re-enter gloucester


gloucester

now lords my choler being over-blown
with walking once about the quadrangle
i come to talk of commonwealth affairs
as for your spiteful false objections
prove them and i lie open to the law
but god in mercy so deal with my soul
as i in duty love my king and country
but to the matter that we have in hand
i say my sovereign york is meetest man
to be your regent in the realm of france


suffolk

before we make election give me leave
to show some reason of no little force
that york is most unmeet of any man


york

ill tell thee suffolk why i am unmeet
first for i cannot flatter thee in pride
next if i be appointed for the place
my lord of somerset will keep me here
without discharge money or furniture
till france be won into the dauphin hands
last time i danced attendance on his will
till paris was besieged famish and lost


warwick

that can i witness and a fouler fact
did never traitor in the land commit


suffolk

peace headstrong warwick


warwick

image of pride why should i hold my peace
enter horner the armourer and his man peter guarded


suffolk

because here is a man accused of treason
pray god the duke of york excuse himself


york

doth any one accuse york for a traitor


king henry vi

what mean thou suffolk tell me what are these


suffolk

please it your majesty this is the man
that doth accuse his master of high treason
his words were these that richard duke of york
was rightful heir unto the english crown
and that your majesty was a usurper


king henry vi

say man were these thy words


horner

ant shall please your majesty i never said nor
thought any such matter god is my witness i am
falsely accused by the villain


peter

by these ten bones my lords he did speak them to
me in the garret one night as we were scouring my
lord of york armour

gloucester

but you have done more miracles than i
you made in a day my lord whole towns to fly
enter buckingham


king henry vi

what tidings with our cousin buckingham


buckingham

such as my heart doth tremble to unfold
a sort of naughty persons lewdly bent
under the countenance and confederacy
of lady eleanor the protector wife
the ringleader and head of all this rout
have practised dangerously against your state
dealing with witches and with conjurers
whom we have apprehended in the fact
raising up wicked spirits from under ground
demanding of king henry life and death
and other of your highness privy-council
as more at large your grace shall understand


cardinal

aside to gloucester  and so my lord protector
by this means
your lady is forthcoming yet at london
this news i think hath turn your weapon edge
tis like my lord you will not keep your hour


gloucester

ambitious churchman leave to afflict my heart
sorrow and grief have vanquish all my powers
and vanquish as i am i yield to thee
or to the meanest groom


king henry vi

o god what mischiefs work the wicked ones
heaping confusion on their own heads thereby


queen margaret

gloucester see here the tainture of thy nest
and look thyself be faultless thou wert best


gloucester

madam for myself to heaven i do appeal
how i have loved my king and commonweal
and for my wife i know not how it stands
sorry i am to hear what i have heard
noble she is but if she have forgot
honour and virtue and conversed with such
as like to pitch defile nobility
i banish her my bed and company
and give her as a prey to law and shame
that hath dishonour gloucester honest name


king henry vi

well for this night we will repose us here
to-morrow toward london back again
to look into this business thoroughly
and call these foul offenders to their answers
and poise the cause in justice equal scales
whose beam stands sure whose rightful cause prevails

scene ii london york garden

enter york salisbury and warwick


york

now my good lords of salisbury and warwick
our simple supper ended give me leave
in this close walk to satisfy myself
in craving your opinion of my title
which is infallible to england crown


salisbury

my lord i long to hear it at full


warwick

sweet york begin and if thy claim be good
the nevils are thy subjects to command


york

then thus
edward the third my lords had seven sons
the first edward the black prince prince of wales
the second william of hatfield and the third
lionel duke of clarence next to whom
was john of gaunt the duke of lancaster
the fifth was edmund langley duke of york
the sixth was thomas of woodstock duke of gloucester
william of windsor was the seventh and last
edward the black prince died before his father
and left behind him richard his only son
who after edward the third death reign as king
till henry bolingbroke duke of lancaster
the eldest son and heir of john of gaunt
crown by the name of henry the fourth
seized on the realm deposed the rightful king
sent his poor queen to france from whence she came
and him to pomfret where as all you know
harmless richard was murder traitorously


warwick

father the duke hath told the truth
thus got the house of lancaster the crown


york

which now they hold by force and not by right
for richard the first son heir being dead
the issue of the next son should have reign


salisbury

but william of hatfield died without an heir


york

the third son duke of clarence from whose line
i claimed the crown had issue philippe a daughter
who married edmund mortimer earl of march
edmund had issue roger earl of march
roger had issue edmund anne and eleanor


salisbury

this edmund in the reign of bolingbroke
as i have read laid claim unto the crown
and but for owen glendower had been king
who kept him in captivity till he died
but to the rest


york

his eldest sister anne
my mother being heir unto the crown
married richard earl of cambridge who was son
to edmund langley edward the third fifth son
by her i claim the kingdom she was heir
to roger earl of march who was the son
of edmund mortimer who married philippe
sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence
so if the issue of the elder son
succeed before the younger i am king


warwick

what plain proceeding is more plain than this
henry doth claim the crown from john of gaunt
the fourth son york claims it from the third
till lionel issue fails his should not reign
it fails not yet but flourishes in thee
and in thy sons fair slips of such a stock
then father salisbury kneel we together
and in this private plot be we the first
that shall salute our rightful sovereign
with honour of his birthright to the crown


both

long live our sovereign richard england king


york

we thank you lords but i am not your king
till i be crown and that my sword be stain
with heart-blood of the house of lancaster
and that not suddenly to be perform
but with advice and silent secrecy
do you as i do in these dangerous days
wink at the duke of suffolk insolence
at beaufort pride at somerset ambition
at buckingham and all the crew of them
till they have snared the shepherd of the flock
that virtuous prince the good duke humphrey
tis that they seek and they in seeking that
shall find their deaths if york can prophesy


salisbury

my lord break we off we know your mind at full


warwick

my heart assures me that the earl of warwick
shall one day make the duke of york a king


york

and nevil this i do assure myself
richard shall live to make the earl of warwick
the greatest man in england but the king

uneath may she endure the flinty streets
to tread them with her tender-feeling feet
sweet nell ill can thy noble mind abrook
the abject people gazing on thy face
with envious looks laughing at thy shame
that erst did follow thy proud chariot-wheels
when thou didst ride in triumph through the streets
but soft i think she comes and ill prepare
my tear-stain eyes to see her miseries
enter the duchess in a white sheet and a taper  burning in her hand with stanley the sheriff and officers


servant

so please your grace well take her from the sheriff

come you my lord to see my open shame

see how the giddy multitude do point
and nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee
ah gloucester hide thee from their hateful looks
and in thy closet pent up rue my shame
and ban thine enemies both mine and thine


gloucester

be patient gentle nell forget this grief


duchess

ah gloucester teach me to forget myself
for whilst i think i am thy married wife
and thou a prince protector of this land
methinks i should not thus be led along
mail up in shame with papers on my back
and followed with a rabble that rejoice
to see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans
the ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet
and when i start the envious people laugh
and bid me be advised how i tread
ah humphrey can i bear this shameful yoke
trow thou that eer ill look upon the world
or count them happy that enjoy the sun
no dark shall be my light and night my day
to think upon my pomp shall be my hell
sometime ill say i am duke humphrey wife
and he a prince and ruler of the land
yet so he ruled and such a prince he was
as he stood by whilst i his forlorn duchess
was made a wonder and a pointing-stock
to every idle rascal follower
but be thou mild and blush not at my shame
nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
hang over thee as sure it shortly will
for suffolk he that can do all in all
with her that hateth thee and hates us all
and york and impious beaufort that false priest
have all limed bushes to betray thy wings
and fly thou how thou canst theyll tangle thee
but fear not thou until thy foot be snared
nor never seek prevention of thy foes


gloucester

ah nell forbear thou aimest all awry
i must offend before i be attainted
and had i twenty times so many foes
and each of them had twenty times their power
all these could not procure me any scathe
so long as i am loyal true and crimeless
wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach
why yet thy scandal were not wiped away
but i in danger for the breach of law
thy greatest help is quiet gentle nell
i pray thee sort thy heart to patience
these few days wonder will be quickly worn

act iii
scene i the abbey at bury st edmund

sound a sennet enter king henry vi queen  margaret cardinal suffolk york buckingham salisbury and warwick to the parliament


king henry vi

i muse my lord of gloucester is not come
tis not his wont to be the hindmost man
whateer occasion keeps him from us now


queen margaret

can you not see or will ye not observe
the strangeness of his alter countenance
with what a majesty he bears himself
how insolent of late he is become
how proud how peremptory and unlike himself
we know the time since he was mild and affable
and if we did but glance a far-off look
immediately he was upon his knee
that all the court admired him for submission
but meet him now and be it in the morn
when every one will give the time of day
he knits his brow and shows an angry eye
and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee
disdaining duty that to us belongs
small curs are not regarded when they grin
but great men tremble when the lion roars
and humphrey is no little man in england
first note that he is near you in descent
and should you fall he as the next will mount
me seemeth then it is no policy
respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
and his advantage following your decease
that he should come about your royal person
or be admitted to your highness council
by flattery hath he won the commons hearts
and when he please to make commotion
tis to be fear they all will follow him
now tis the spring and weeds are shallow-rooted
suffer them now and theyll oergrow the garden
and choke the herbs for want of husbandry
the reverent care i bear unto my lord
made me collect these dangers in the duke
if it be fond call it a woman fear
which fear if better reasons can supplant
i will subscribe and say i wrong the duke
my lord of suffolk buckingham and york
reprove my allegation if you can
or else conclude my words effectual


suffolk

well hath your highness seen into this duke
and had i first been put to speak my mind
i think i should have told your grace tale
the duchess by his subornation
upon my life began her devilish practises
or if he were not privy to those faults
yet by reputing of his high descent
as next the king he was successive heir
and such high vaunts of his nobility
did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess
by wicked means to frame our sovereign fall
smooth runs the water where the brook is deep
and in his simple show he harbours treason
the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb
no no my sovereign gloucester is a man
unsounded yet and full of deep deceit


cardinal

did he not contrary to form of law
devise strange deaths for small offences done


york

and did he not in his protectorship
levy great sums of money through the realm
for soldiers pay in france and never sent it
by means whereof the towns each day revolted


buckingham

tut these are petty faults to faults unknown
which time will bring to light in smooth
duke humphrey


king henry vi

my lords at once the care you have of us
to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot
is worthy praise but shall i speak my conscience
our kinsman gloucester is as innocent
from meaning treason to our royal person
as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove
the duke is virtuous mild and too well given
to dream on evil or to work my downfall


queen margaret

ah what more dangerous than this fond affiance
seems he a dove his feathers are but borrowed
for he disposed as the hateful raven
is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him
for he inclined as is the ravenous wolf
who cannot steal a shape that means deceit
take heed my lord the welfare of us all
hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man
enter somerset


somerset

all health unto my gracious sovereign


king henry vi

welcome lord somerset what news from france


somerset

that all your interest in those territories
is utterly bereft you all is lost


king henry vi

cold news lord somerset but god will be done


york

aside  cold news for me for i had hope of france
as firmly as i hope for fertile england
thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
and caterpillars eat my leaves away
but i will remedy this gear ere long
or sell my title for a glorious grave
enter gloucester


gloucester

all happiness unto my lord the king
pardon my liege that i have stay so long


suffolk

nay gloucester know that thou art come too soon
unless thou wert more loyal than thou art
i do arrest thee of high treason here


gloucester

well suffolk thou shalt not see me blush
nor change my countenance for this arrest
a heart unspotted is not easily daunted
the purest spring is not so free from mud
as i am clear from treason to my sovereign
who can accuse me wherein am i guilty


york

tis thought my lord that you took bribes of france
and being protector stayed the soldiers pay
by means whereof his highness hath lost france


gloucester

is it but thought so what are they that think it
i never robb the soldiers of their pay
nor ever had one penny bribe from france
so help me god as i have watch the night
ay night by night in studying good for england
that doit that eer i wrested from the king
or any groat i hoarded to my use
be brought against me at my trial-day
no many a pound of mine own proper store
because i would not tax the needy commons
have i disbursed to the garrisons
and never ask for restitution


cardinal

it serves you well my lord to say so much


gloucester

i say no more than truth so help me god


york

in your protectorship you did devise
strange tortures for offenders never heard of
that england was defamed by tyranny


gloucester

why tis well known that whiles i was
protector
pity was all the fault that was in me
for i should melt at an offender tears
and lowly words were ransom for their fault
unless it were a bloody murderer
or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers
i never gave them condign punishment
murder indeed that bloody sin i tortured
above the felon or what trespass else


suffolk

my lord these faults are easy quickly answered
but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge
whereof you cannot easily purge yourself
i do arrest you in his highness name
and here commit you to my lord cardinal
to keep until your further time of trial


king henry vi

my lord of gloucester tis my special hope
that you will clear yourself from all suspect
my conscience tells me you are innocent


gloucester

ah gracious lord these days are dangerous
virtue is choked with foul ambition
and charity chased hence by rancour hand
foul subornation is predominant
and equity exiled your highness land
i know their complot is to have my life
and if my death might make this island happy
and prove the period of their tyranny
i would expend it with all willingness
but mine is made the prologue to their play
for thousands more that yet suspect no peril
will not conclude their plotted tragedy
beaufort red sparkling eyes blab his heart malice
and suffolk cloudy brow his stormy hate
sharp buckingham unburthens with his tongue
the envious load that lies upon his heart
and dogged york that reaches at the moon
whose overweening arm i have pluck back
by false accuse doth level at my life
and you my sovereign lady with the rest
causeless have laid disgraces on my head
and with your best endeavour have stirr up
my liefest liege to be mine enemy
ay all you have laid your heads together 
myself had notice of your conventicles 
and all to make away my guiltless life
i shall not want false witness to condemn me
nor store of treasons to augment my guilt
the ancient proverb will be well effected
a staff is quickly found to beat a dog


cardinal

my liege his railing is intolerable
if those that care to keep your royal person
from treason secret knife and traitors rage
be thus upbraided chid and rated at
and the offender granted scope of speech
twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace


suffolk

hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
with ignominious words though clerkly couch
as if she had suborned some to swear
false allegations to oerthrow his state


queen margaret

but i can give the loser leave to chide


gloucester

far truer spoke than meant i lose indeed
beshrew the winners for they play me false
and well such losers may have leave to speak


buckingham

hell wrest the sense and hold us here all day
lord cardinal he is your prisoner


cardinal

sirs take away the duke and guard him sure


gloucester

ah thus king henry throws away his crutch
before his legs be firm to bear his body
thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side
and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first
ah that my fear were false ah that it were
for good king henry thy decay i fear
exit guarded


king henry vi

my lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best
do or undo as if ourself were here


queen margaret

what will your highness leave the parliament


king henry vi

ay margaret my heart is drown with grief
whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes
my body round engirt with misery
for what more miserable than discontent
ah uncle humphrey in thy face i see
the map of honour truth and loyalty
and yet good humphrey is the hour to come
that eer i proved thee false or fear thy faith
what louring star now envies thy estate
that these great lords and margaret our queen
do seek subversion of thy harmless life
thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong
and as the butcher takes away the calf
and binds the wretch and beats it when it strays
bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house
even so remorseless have they borne him hence
and as the dam runs lowing up and down
looking the way her harmless young one went
and can do nought but wail her darling loss
even so myself bewails good gloucester case
with sad unhelpful tears and with dimm eyes
look after him and cannot do him good
so mighty are his vowed enemies
his fortunes i will weep and twixt each groan
say who a traitor gloucester he is none
exeunt all but queen margaret cardinal suffolk and york somerset remains apart


queen margaret

free lords cold snow melts with the sun hot beams
henry my lord is cold in great affairs
too full of foolish pity and gloucester show
beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
with sorrow snares relenting passengers
or as the snake roll in a flowering bank
with shining chequer slough doth sting a child
that for the beauty thinks it excellent
believe me lords were none more wise than i 
and yet herein i judge mine own wit good 
this gloucester should be quickly rid the world
to rid us of the fear we have of him


cardinal

that he should die is worthy policy
but yet we want a colour for his death
tis meet he be condemn by course of law


suffolk

but in my mind that were no policy
the king will labour still to save his life
the commons haply rise to save his life
and yet we have but trivial argument
more than mistrust that shows him worthy death


york

so that by this you would not have him die


suffolk

ah york no man alive so fain as i


york

tis york that hath more reason for his death
but my lord cardinal and you my lord of suffolk
say as you think and speak it from your souls
weret not all one an empty eagle were set
to guard the chicken from a hungry kite
as place duke humphrey for the king protector


queen margaret

so the poor chicken should be sure of death


suffolk

madam tis true and weret not madness then
to make the fox surveyor of the fold
who being accused a crafty murderer
his guilt should be but idly posted over
because his purpose is not executed
no let him die in that he is a fox
by nature proved an enemy to the flock
before his chaps be stain with crimson blood
as humphrey proved by reasons to my liege
and do not stand on quillets how to slay him
be it by gins by snares by subtlety
sleeping or waking tis no matter how
so he be dead for that is good deceit
which mates him first that first intends deceit


queen margaret

thrice-noble suffolk tis resolutely spoke


suffolk

not resolute except so much were done
for things are often spoke and seldom meant
but that my heart accordeth with my tongue
seeing the deed is meritorious
and to preserve my sovereign from his foe
say but the word and i will be his priest


cardinal

but i would have him dead my lord of suffolk
ere you can take due orders for a priest
say you consent and censure well the deed
and ill provide his executioner
i tender so the safety of my liege


suffolk

here is my hand the deed is worthy doing


queen margaret

and so say i


york

and i    and now we three have spoke it
it skills not greatly who impugns our doom
enter a post


post

great lords from ireland am i come amain
to signify that rebels there are up
and put the englishmen unto the sword
send succors lords and stop the rage betime
before the wound do grow uncurable
for being green there is great hope of help


cardinal

a breach that craves a quick expedient stop
what counsel give you in this weighty cause


york

that somerset be sent as regent thither
tis meet that lucky ruler be employ
witness the fortune he hath had in france


somerset

if york with all his far-fet policy
had been the regent there instead of me
he never would have stay in france so long


york

no not to lose it all as thou hast done
i rather would have lost my life betimes
than bring a burthen of dishonour home
by staying there so long till all were lost
show me one scar character on thy skin
men flesh preserved so whole do seldom win


queen margaret

nay then this spark will prove a raging fire
if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with
no more good york sweet somerset be still
thy fortune york hadst thou been regent there
might happily have proved far worse than his


york

what worse than nought nay then a shame take all


somerset

and in the number thee that wishest shame


cardinal

my lord of york try what your fortune is
the uncivil kerns of ireland are in arms
and temper clay with blood of englishmen
to ireland will you lead a band of men
collected choicely from each county some
and try your hap against the irishmen


york

i will my lord so please his majesty


suffolk

why our authority is his consent
and what we do establish he confirms
then noble york take thou this task in hand


york

i am content provide me soldiers lords
whiles i take order for mine own affairs


suffolk

a charge lord york that i will see perform
but now return we to the false duke humphrey


cardinal

no more of him for i will deal with him
that henceforth he shall trouble us no more
and so break off the day is almost spent
lord suffolk you and i must talk of that event


york

my lord of suffolk within fourteen days
at bristol i expect my soldiers
for there ill ship them all for ireland


suffolk

ill see it truly done my lord of york
exeunt all but york


york

now york or never steel thy fearful thoughts
and change misdoubt to resolution
be that thou hopest to be or what thou art
resign to death it is not worth the enjoying
let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man
and find no harbour in a royal heart
faster than spring-time showers comes thought
on thought
and not a thought but thinks on dignity
my brain more busy than the labouring spider
weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies
well nobles well tis politicly done
to send me packing with an host of men
i fear me you but warm the starved snake
who cherish in your breasts will sting
your hearts
twas men i lack and you will give them me
i take it kindly and yet be well assured
you put sharp weapons in a madman hands
whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band
i will stir up in england some black storm
shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell
and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
until the golden circuit on my head
like to the glorious sun transparent beams
do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw
and for a minister of my intent
i have seduced a headstrong kentishman
john cade of ashford
to make commotion as full well he can
under the title of john mortimer
in ireland have i seen this stubborn cade
oppose himself against a troop of kerns
and fought so long till that his thighs with darts
were almost like a sharp-quill porpentine
and in the end being rescued i have seen
him caper upright like a wild morisco
shaking the bloody darts as he his bells
full often like a shag-hair crafty kern
hath he conversed with the enemy
and undiscover come to me again
and given me notice of their villanies
this devil here shall be my substitute
for that john mortimer which now is dead
in face in gait in speech he doth resemble
by this i shall perceive the commons mind
how they affect the house and claim of york
say he be taken rack and tortured
i know no pain they can inflict upon him
will make him say i moved him to those arms
say that he thrive as tis great like he will
why then from ireland come i with my strength
and reap the harvest which that rascal sow
for humphrey being dead as he shall be
and henry put apart the next for me
exit

king henry vi

say we intend to try his grace to-day
if he be guilty as tis published


suffolk

ill call him presently my noble lord
exit


king henry vi

lords take your places and i pray you all
proceed no straiter gainst our uncle gloucester
than from true evidence of good esteem
he be approved in practise culpable


queen margaret

god forbid any malice should prevail
that faultless may condemn a nobleman
pray god he may acquit him of suspicion


king henry vi

i thank thee meg these words content me much
re-enter suffolk
how now why look thou pale why tremblest thou
where is our uncle what the matter suffolk


suffolk

dead in his bed my lord gloucester is dead


queen margaret

marry god forfend


cardinal

god secret judgment i did dream to-night
the duke was dumb and could not speak a word
king henry vi swoons


queen margaret

how fares my lord help lords the king is dead


somerset

rear up his body wring him by the nose


queen margaret

run go help help o henry ope thine eyes


suffolk

he doth revive again madam be patient


king henry vi

o heavenly god


queen margaret

how fares my gracious lord


suffolk

comfort my sovereign gracious henry comfort


king henry vi

what doth my lord of suffolk comfort me
came he right now to sing a raven note
whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers
and thinks he that the chirping of a wren
by crying comfort from a hollow breast
can chase away the first-conceived sound
hide not thy poison with such sugar words
lay not thy hands on me forbear i say
their touch affrights me as a serpent sting
thou baleful messenger out of my sight
upon thy eye-balls murderous tyranny
sits in grim majesty to fright the world
look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding
yet do not go away come basilisk
and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight
for in the shade of death i shall find joy
in life but double death now gloucester dead


queen margaret

why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus
although the duke was enemy to him
yet he most christian-like laments his death
and for myself foe as he was to me
might liquid tears or heart-offending groans
or blood-consuming sighs recall his life
i would be blind with weeping sick with groans
look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs
and all to have the noble duke alive
what know i how the world may deem of me
for it is known we were but hollow friends
it may be judged i made the duke away
so shall my name with slander tongue be wounded
and princes courts be fill with my reproach
this get i by his death ay me unhappy
to be a queen and crown with infamy


king henry vi

ah woe is me for gloucester wretched man


queen margaret

be woe for me more wretched than he is
what dost thou turn away and hide thy face
i am no loathsome leper look on me
what art thou like the adder waxen deaf
be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen
is all thy comfort shut in gloucester tomb
why then dame margaret was neer thy joy
erect his statue and worship it
and make my image but an alehouse sign
was i for this nigh wreck upon the sea
and twice by awkward wind from england bank
drove back again unto my native clime
what boded this but well forewarning wind
did seem to say eek not a scorpion nest
nor set no footing on this unkind shore
what did i then but cursed the gentle gusts
and he that loosed them forth their brazen caves
and bid them blow towards england blessed shore
or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
yet aeolus would not be a murderer
but left that hateful office unto thee
the pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me
knowing that thou wouldst have me drown on shore
with tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness
the splitting rocks cower in the sinking sands
and would not dash me with their ragged sides
because thy flinty heart more hard than they
might in thy palace perish margaret
as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs
when from thy shore the tempest beat us back
i stood upon the hatches in the storm
and when the dusky sky began to rob
my earnest-gaping sight of thy land view
i took a costly jewel from my neck
a heart it was bound in with diamonds
and threw it towards thy land the sea received it
and so i wish thy body might my heart
and even with this i lost fair england view
and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
and call them blind and dusky spectacles
for losing ken of albion wished coast
how often have i tempted suffolk tongue
the agent of thy foul inconstancy
to sit and witch me as ascanius did
when he to madding dido would unfold
his father acts commenced in burning troy
am i not witch like her or thou not false like him
ay me i can no more die margaret
for henry weeps that thou dost live so long
noise within enter warwick salisbury and many commons


warwick

it is reported mighty sovereign
that good duke humphrey traitorously is murder
by suffolk and the cardinal beaufort means
the commons like an angry hive of bees
that want their leader scatter up and down
and care not who they sting in his revenge
myself have calm their spleenful mutiny
until they hear the order of his death


king henry vi

that he is dead good warwick tis too true
but how he died god knows not henry
enter his chamber view his breathless corpse
and comment then upon his sudden death


warwick

that shall i do my liege stay salisbury
with the rude multitude till i return
exit


king henry vi

o thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts
my thoughts that labour to persuade my soul
some violent hands were laid on humphrey life
if my suspect be false forgive me god
for judgment only doth belong to thee
fain would i go to chafe his paly lips
with twenty thousand kisses and to drain
upon his face an ocean of salt tears
to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk
and with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling
but all in vain are these mean obsequies
and to survey his dead and earthly image
what were it but to make my sorrow greater
re-enter warwick and others bearing gloucester body on a bed


warwick

come hither gracious sovereign view this body


king henry vi

that is to see how deep my grave is made
for with his soul fled all my worldly solace
for seeing him i see my life in death


warwick

as surely as my soul intends to live
with that dread king that took our state upon him
to free us from his father wrathful curse
i do believe that violent hands were laid
upon the life of this thrice-famed duke


suffolk

a dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue
what instance gives lord warwick for his vow


warwick

see how the blood is settled in his face
oft have i seen a timely-parted ghost
of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless
being all descended to the labouring heart
who in the conflict that it holds with death
attracts the same for aidance gainst the enemy
which with the heart there cools and neer returneth
to blush and beautify the cheek again
but see his face is black and full of blood
his eye-balls further out than when he lived
staring full ghastly like a strangled man
his hair uprear his nostrils stretched with struggling
his hands abroad display as one that grasp
and tugg for life and was by strength subdued
look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking
his well-proportion beard made rough and rugged
like to the summer corn by tempest lodged
it cannot be but he was murder here
the least of all these signs were probable


suffolk

why warwick who should do the duke to death
myself and beaufort had him in protection
and we i hope sir are no murderers


warwick

but both of you were vow duke humphrey foes
and you forsooth had the good duke to keep
tis like you would not feast him like a friend
and tis well seen he found an enemy


queen margaret

then you belike suspect these noblemen
as guilty of duke humphrey timeless death


warwick

who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
and sees fast by a butcher with an axe
but will suspect twas he that made the slaughter
who finds the partridge in the puttock nest
but may imagine how the bird was dead
although the kite soar with unbloodied beak
even so suspicious is this tragedy


queen margaret

are you the butcher suffolk where your knife
is beaufort term a kite where are his talons


suffolk

i wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men
but here a vengeful sword rusted with ease
that shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
that slanders me with murder crimson badge
say if thou darest proud lord of warwick-shire
that i am faulty in duke humphrey death
exeunt cardinal somerset and others


warwick

what dares not warwick if false suffolk dare him


queen margaret

he dares not calm his contumelious spirit
nor cease to be an arrogant controller
though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times


warwick

madam be still with reverence may i say
for every word you speak in his behalf
is slander to your royal dignity


suffolk

blunt-witted lord ignoble in demeanor
if ever lady wrong her lord so much
thy mother took into her blameful bed
some stern untutor churl and noble stock
was graft with crab-tree slip whose fruit thou art
and never of the nevils noble race


warwick

but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee
and i should rob the deathsman of his fee
quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames
and that my sovereign presence makes me mild
i would false murderous coward on thy knee
make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech
and say it was thy mother that thou meant
that thou thyself was born in bastardy
and after all this fearful homage done
give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell
pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men


suffolk

thou shall be waking well i shed thy blood
if from this presence thou darest go with me


warwick

away even now or i will drag thee hence
unworthy though thou art ill cope with thee
and do some service to duke humphrey ghost
exeunt suffolk and warwick


king henry vi

what stronger breastplate than a heart untainted
thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just
and he but naked though lock up in steel
whose conscience with injustice is corrupted
a noise within


queen margaret

what noise is this
re-enter suffolk and warwick with their weapons drawn


king henry vi

why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn
here in our presence dare you be so bold
why what tumultuous clamour have we here


suffolk

the traitorous warwick with the men of bury
set all upon me mighty sovereign


salisbury

to the commons entering  sirs stand apart
the king shall know your mind
dread lord the commons send you word by me
unless lord suffolk straight be done to death
or banished fair england territories
they will by violence tear him from your palace
and torture him with grievous lingering death
they say by him the good duke humphrey died
they say in him they fear your highness death
and mere instinct of love and loyalty
free from a stubborn opposite intent
as being thought to contradict your liking
makes them thus forward in his banishment
they say in care of your most royal person
that if your highness should intend to sleep
and charge that no man should disturb your rest
in pain of your dislike or pain of death
yet notwithstanding such a strait edict
were there a serpent seen with forked tongue
that slily glided towards your majesty
it were but necessary you were waked
lest being suffer in that harmful slumber
the mortal worm might make the sleep eternal
and therefore do they cry though you forbid
that they will guard you whether you will or no
from such fell serpents as false suffolk is
with whose envenomed and fatal sting
your loving uncle twenty times his worth
they say is shamefully bereft of life


commons

within  an answer from the king my
lord of salisbury


suffolk

tis like the commons rude unpolish hinds
could send such message to their sovereign
but you my lord were glad to be employ
to show how quaint an orator you are
but all the honour salisbury hath won
is that he was the lord ambassador
sent from a sort of tinkers to the king


commons

within  an answer from the king or we will all break in


king henry vi

go salisbury and tell them all from me
i thank them for their tender loving care
and had i not been cited so by them
yet did i purpose as they do entreat
for sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy
mischance unto my state by suffolk means
and therefore by his majesty i swear
whose far unworthy deputy i am
he shall not breathe infection in this air
but three days longer on the pain of death
exit salisbury


queen margaret

o henry let me plead for gentle suffolk


king henry vi

ungentle queen to call him gentle suffolk
no more i say if thou dost plead for him
thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath
had i but said i would have kept my word
but when i swear it is irrevocable
if after three days space thou here be found
on any ground that i am ruler of
the world shall not be ransom for thy life
come warwick come good warwick go with me
i have great matters to impart to thee
exeunt all but queen margaret and suffolk


queen margaret

mischance and sorrow go along with you
heart discontent and sour affliction
be playfellows to keep you company
there two of you the devil make a third
and threefold vengeance tend upon your steps


suffolk

cease gentle queen these execrations
and let thy suffolk take his heavy leave


queen margaret

fie coward woman and soft-hearted wretch
hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy


suffolk

a plague upon them wherefore should i curse them
would curses kill as doth the mandrake groan
i would invent as bitter-searching terms
as curst as harsh and horrible to hear
deliver strongly through my fixed teeth
with full as many signs of deadly hate
as lean-faced envy in her loathsome cave
my tongue should stumble in mine earnest words
mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint
mine hair be fixed on end as one distract
ay every joint should seem to curse and ban
and even now my burthen heart would break
should i not curse them poison be their drink
gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste
their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees
their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks
their softest touch as smart as lizards sting
their music frightful as the serpent hiss
and boding screech-owls make the concert full
all the foul terrors in dark-seated hell 


queen margaret

enough sweet suffolk thou torment thyself
and these dread curses like the sun gainst glass
or like an overcharged gun recoil
and turn the force of them upon thyself


suffolk

you bade me ban and will you bid me leave
now by the ground that i am banish from
well could i curse away a winter night
though standing naked on a mountain top
where biting cold would never let grass grow
and think it but a minute spent in sport


queen margaret

o let me entreat thee cease give me thy hand
that i may dew it with my mournful tears
nor let the rain of heaven wet this place
to wash away my woful monuments
o could this kiss be printed in thy hand
that thou mightst think upon these by the seal
through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee
so get thee gone that i may know my grief
tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by
as one that surfeits thinking on a want
i will repeal thee or be well assured
adventure to be banished myself
and banished i am if but from thee
go speak not to me even now be gone
o go not yet even thus two friends condemn
embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves
loather a hundred times to part than die

suffolk

once by the king and three times thrice by thee

enter vaux


queen margaret

wither goes vaux so fast what news i prithee


vaux

to signify unto his majesty
that cardinal beaufort is at point of death
for suddenly a grievous sickness took him
that makes him gasp and stare and catch the air
blaspheming god and cursing men on earth
sometimes he talks as if duke humphrey ghost
were by his side sometime he calls the king
and whispers to his pillow as to him
the secrets of his overcharged soul
and i am sent to tell his majesty
that even now he cries aloud for him


queen margaret

go tell this heavy message to the king
exit vaux
ay me what is this world what news are these
but wherefore grieve i at an hour poor loss
omitting suffolk exile my soul treasure
why only suffolk mourn i not for thee
and with the southern clouds contend in tears
theirs for the earth increase mine for my sorrows
now get thee hence the king thou know is coming
if thou be found by me thou art but dead


suffolk

if i depart from thee i cannot live
and in thy sight to die what were it else
but like a pleasant slumber in thy lap
here could i breathe my soul into the air
as mild and gentle as the cradle-babe
dying with mother dug between its lips
where from thy sight i should be raging mad
and cry out for thee to close up mine eyes
to have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth
so shouldst thou either turn my flying soul
or i should breathe it so into thy body
and then it lived in sweet elysium
to die by thee were but to die in jest
from thee to die were torture more than death
o let me stay befall what may befall


queen margaret

away though parting be a fretful corrosive
it is applied to a deathful wound
to france sweet suffolk let me hear from thee
for wheresoeer thou art in this world globe
ill have an iris that shall find thee out


suffolk

i go


queen margaret

and take my heart with thee


suffolk

a jewel lock into the wofull cask
that ever did contain a thing of worth
even as a splitted bark so sunder we
this way fall i to death


queen margaret

this way for me

king henry vi

act iv
scene i the coast of kent

alarum fight at sea ordnance goes off enter a  captain a master a master-mate walter whitmore and others with them suffolk and others prisoners


captain

the gaudy blabbing and remorseful day
is crept into the bosom of the sea
and now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
that drag the tragic melancholy night
who with their drowsy slow and flagging wings
clip dead men graves and from their misty jaws
breathe foul contagious darkness in the air
therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize
for whilst our pinnace anchors in the downs
here shall they make their ransom on the sand
or with their blood stain this discolour shore
master this prisoner freely give i thee
and thou that art his mate make boot of this
the other walter whitmore is thy share


first gentleman

what is my ransom master let me know


master

a thousand crowns or else lay down your head
master-mateand so much shall you give or off goes yours


captain

what think you much to pay two thousand crowns
and bear the name and port of gentlemen
cut both the villains throats for die you shall
the lives of those which we have lost in fight
be counterpoised with such a petty sum


first gentleman

ill give it sir and therefore spare my life


second gentleman

and so will i and write home for it straight


whitmore

i lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard
and therefore to revenge it shalt thou die
to suffolk
and so should these if i might have my will


captain

be not so rash take ransom let him live


suffolk

look on my george i am a gentleman
rate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paid


whitmore

and so am i my name is walter whitmore
how now why start thou what doth
death affright


suffolk

thy name affrights me in whose sound is death
a cunning man did calculate my birth
and told me that by water i should die
yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded
thy name is gaultier being rightly sounded


whitmore

gaultier or walter which it is i care not
never yet did base dishonour blur our name
but with our sword we wiped away the blot
therefore when merchant-like i sell revenge
broke be my sword my arms torn and defaced
and i proclaim a coward through the world


suffolk

stay whitmore for thy prisoner is a prince
the duke of suffolk william de la pole


whitmore

the duke of suffolk muffled up in rags


suffolk

ay but these rags are no part of the duke
jove sometimes went disguised and why not i


captain

but jove was never slain as thou shalt be


suffolk

obscure and lowly swain king henry blood
the honourable blood of lancaster
must not be shed by such a jaded groom
hast thou not kiss thy hand and held my stirrup
bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule
and thought thee happy when i shook my head
how often hast thou waited at my cup
fed from my trencher kneel down at the board
when i have feasted with queen margaret
remember it and let it make thee crest-falln
ay and allay this thy abortive pride
how in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
and duly waited for my coming forth
this hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf
and therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue


whitmore

speak captain shall i stab the forlorn swain


captain

first let my words stab him as he hath me


suffolk

base slave thy words are blunt and so art thou


captain

convey him hence and on our longboat side
strike off his head


suffolk

thou darest not for thy own


captain

yes pole


suffolk

pole


captain

pool sir pool lord
ay kennel puddle sink whose filth and dirt
troubles the silver spring where england drinks
now will i dam up this thy yawning mouth
for swallowing the treasure of the realm
thy lips that kiss the queen shall sweep the ground
and thou that smiledst at good duke humphrey death
against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain
who in contempt shall hiss at thee again
and wedded be thou to the hags of hell
for daring to affy a mighty lord
unto the daughter of a worthless king
having neither subject wealth nor diadem
by devilish policy art thou grown great
and like ambitious sylla overgorged
with gobbets of thy mother bleeding heart
by thee anjou and maine were sold to france
the false revolting normans thorough thee
disdain to call us lord and picardy
hath slain their governors surprised our forts
and sent the ragged soldiers wounded home
the princely warwick and the nevils all
whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain
as hating thee are rising up in arms
and now the house of york thrust from the crown
by shameful murder of a guiltless king
and lofty proud encroaching tyranny
burns with revenging fire whose hopeful colours
advance our half-faced sun striving to shine
under the which is writ invitis nubibus
the commons here in kent are up in arms
and to conclude reproach and beggary
is crept into the palace of our king
and all by thee away convey him hence


suffolk

o that i were a god to shoot forth thunder
upon these paltry servile abject drudges
small things make base men proud this villain here
being captain of a pinnace threatens more
than bargulus the strong illyrian pirate
drones suck not eagles blood but rob beehives
it is impossible that i should die
by such a lowly vassal as thyself
thy words move rage and not remorse in me
i go of message from the queen to france
i charge thee waft me safely cross the channel


captain

walter 


whitmore

come suffolk i must waft thee to thy death


suffolk

gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee i fear


whitmore

thou shalt have cause to fear before i leave thee
what are ye daunted now now will ye stoop


first gentleman

my gracious lord entreat him speak him fair


suffolk

suffolk imperial tongue is stern and rough
used to command untaught to plead for favour
far be it we should honour such as these
with humble suit no rather let my head
stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
save to the god of heaven and to my king
and sooner dance upon a bloody pole
than stand uncover to the vulgar groom
true nobility is exempt from fear
more can i bear than you dare execute


captain

hale him away and let him talk no more


suffolk

come soldiers show what cruelty ye can
that this my death may never be forgot
great men oft die by vile bezonians
a roman sworder and banditto slave
murder sweet tully brutus bastard hand
stabb julius caesar savage islanders
pompey the great and suffolk dies by pirates
exeunt whitmore and others with suffolk


captain

and as for these whose ransom we have set
it is our pleasure one of them depart
therefore come you with us and let him go
exeunt all but the first gentleman
re-enter whitmore with suffolk body


whitmore

there let his head and lifeless body lie
until the queen his mistress bury it
exit


first gentleman

o barbarous and bloody spectacle
his body will i bear unto the king
if he revenge it not yet will his friends
so will the queen that living held him dear
exit with the body

corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a
grammar school and whereas before our forefathers
had no other books but the score and the tally thou
hast caused printing to be used and contrary to
the king his crown and dignity thou hast built a
paper-mill it will be proved to thy face that thou
hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and
a verb and such abominable words as no christian
ear can endure to hear thou hast appointed
justices of peace to call poor men before them
about matters they were not able to answer
moreover thou hast put them in prison and because
they could not read thou hast hanged them when
indeed only for that cause they have been most
worthy to live thou dost ride in a foot-cloth dost thou not

that you should leave me at the white hart in
southwark i thought ye would never have given out
these arms till you had recovered your ancient
freedom but you are all recreants and dastards

houses over your heads ravish your wives and
daughters before your faces for me i will make
shift for one and so god curse light upon you

clifford

that thus you do exclaim youll go with him
will he conduct you through the heart of france
and make the meanest of you earls and dukes
alas he hath no home no place to fly to
nor knows he how to live but by the spoil
unless by robbing of your friends and us
weret not a shame that whilst you live at jar
the fearful french whom you late vanquished
should make a start oer seas and vanquish you
methinks already in this civil broil
i see them lording it in london streets
crying villiago unto all they meet
better ten thousand base-born cades miscarry
than you should stoop unto a frenchman mercy
to france to france and get what you have lost
spare england for it is your native coast
henry hath money you are strong and manly
god on our side doubt not of victory

fie on ambition fie on myself that have a sword
and yet am ready to famish these five days have i
hid me in these woods and durst not peep out for
all the country is laid for me but now am i so
hungry that if i might have a lease of my life for a
thousand years i could stay no longer wherefore
on a brick wall have i climbed into this garden to
see if i can eat grass or pick a sallet another
while which is not amiss to cool a man stomach
this hot weather and i think this word allet
was born to do me good for many a time but for a
sallet my brainpan had been cleft with a brown
bill and many a time when i have been dry and
bravely marching it hath served me instead of a
quart pot to drink in and now the word allet
must serve me to feed on

broached and beard thee too look on me well i

nay it shall neer be said while england stands
that alexander iden an esquire of kent
took odds to combat a poor famish man
oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine
see if thou canst outface me with thy looks
set limb to limb and thou art far the lesser
thy hand is but a finger to my fist
thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon
my foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast
and if mine arm be heaved in the air
thy grave is digg already in the earth
as for words whose greatness answers words
let this my sword report what speech forbears


cade

by my valour the most complete champion that ever i
heard steel if thou turn the edge or cut not out
the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou
sleep in thy sheath i beseech god on my knees thou
mayst be turned to hobnails

o i am slain famine and no other hath slain me
let ten thousand devils come against me and give me
but the ten meals i have lost and ill defy them
all wither garden and be henceforth a
burying-place to all that do dwell in this house
because the unconquered soul of cade is fled


iden

ist cade that i have slain that monstrous traitor
sword i will hollow thee for this thy deed
and hang thee oer my tomb when i am dead
neer shall this blood be wiped from thy point
but thou shalt wear it as a herald coat
to emblaze the honour that thy master got


cade

iden farewell and be proud of thy victory tell
kent from me she hath lost her best man and exhort
all the world to be cowards for i that never
feared any am vanquished by famine not by valour

how much thou wrong me heaven be my judge
die damned wretch the curse of her that bare thee

which i will bear in triumph to the king

york

humphrey of buckingham i accept thy greeting
art thou a messenger or come of pleasure


buckingham

a messenger from henry our dread liege
to know the reason of these arms in peace
or why thou being a subject as i am
against thy oath and true allegiance sworn
should raise so great a power without his leave
or dare to bring thy force so near the court


york

aside  scarce can i speak my choler is so great
o i could hew up rocks and fight with flint
i am so angry at these abject terms
and now like ajax telamonius
on sheep or oxen could i spend my fury
i am far better born than is the king
more like a king more kingly in my thoughts
but i must make fair weather yet a while
till henry be more weak and i more strong 
buckingham i prithee pardon me
that i have given no answer all this while
my mind was troubled with deep melancholy
the cause why i have brought this army hither
is to remove proud somerset from the king
seditious to his grace and to the state


buckingham

that is too much presumption on thy part
but if thy arms be to no other end
the king hath yielded unto thy demand
the duke of somerset is in the tower

upon thine honour is he prisoner


buckingham

upon mine honour he is prisoner

false king why hast thou broken faith with me
knowing how hardly i can brook abuse
king did i call thee no thou art not king
not fit to govern and rule multitudes
which darest not no nor canst not rule a traitor
that head of thine doth not become a crown
thy hand is made to grasp a palmer staff
and not to grace an awful princely sceptre
that gold must round engirt these brows of mine
whose smile and frown like to achilles spear
is able with the change to kill and cure
here is a hand to hold a sceptre up
and with the same to act controlling laws
give place by heaven thou shalt rule no more

run back and bite because he was withheld
who being suffer with the bear fell paw
hath clapp his tail between his legs and cried

if you oppose yourselves to match lord warwick


clifford

hence heap of wrath foul indigested lump
as crooked in thy manners as thy shape

why warwick hath thy knee forgot to bow
old salisbury shame to thy silver hair
thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son
what wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian
and seek for sorrow with thy spectacles
o where is faith o where is loyalty
if it be banish from the frosty head
where shall it find a harbour in the earth
wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war
and shame thine honourable age with blood
why art thou old and want experience
or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it
for shame in duty bend thy knee to me
that bows unto the grave with mickle age


salisbury

my lord i have consider with myself
the title of this most renowned duke
and in my conscience do repute his grace
the rightful heir to england royal seat


king henry vi

hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me


salisbury

i have


king henry vi

canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath


salisbury

it is great sin to swear unto a sin
but greater sin to keep a sinful oath
who can be bound by any solemn vow
to do a murderous deed to rob a man
to force a spotless virgin chastity
to reave the orphan of his patrimony
to wring the widow from her custom right
and have no other reason for this wrong
but that he was bound by a solemn oath


queen margaret

a subtle traitor needs no sophister


king henry vi

call buckingham and bid him arm himself


york

call buckingham and all the friends thou hast
i am resolved for death or dignity


clifford

the first i warrant thee if dreams prove true


warwick

you were best to go to bed and dream again
to keep thee from the tempest of the field


clifford

i am resolved to bear a greater storm
than any thou canst conjure up to-day
and that ill write upon thy burgonet
might i but know thee by thy household badge


warwick

now by my father badge old nevil crest
the rampant bear chain to the ragged staff
this day ill wear aloft my burgonet
as on a mountain top the cedar shows
that keeps his leaves in spite of any storm
even to affright thee with the view thereof


clifford

and from thy burgonet ill rend thy bear
and tread it under foot with all contempt
despite the bear-ward that protects the bear


young clifford

and so to arms victorious father
to quell the rebels and their complices

for you shall sup with jesu christ to-night

for he that interrupts him shall not live


king henry vi

think thou that i will leave my kingly throne
wherein my grandsire and my father sat
no first shall war unpeople this my realm
ay and their colours often borne in france
and now in england to our heart great sorrow
shall be my winding-sheet why faint you lords
my title good and better far than his


warwick

king henry vi

york

king henry vi

aside  i know not what to say my title weak 
tell me may not a king adopt an heir


york

king henry vi

an if he may then am i lawful king
for richard in the view of many lords
resign the crown to henry the fourth
whose heir my father was and i am his


york

he rose against him being his sovereign
and made him to resign his crown perforce


warwick

exeter

no for he could not so resign his crown
but that the next heir should succeed and reign


king henry vi

exeter

york

exeter

my conscience tells me he is lawful king


king henry vi

aside  all will revolt from me and turn to him


northumberland

plantagenet for all the claim thou lay
think not that henry shall be so deposed


warwick

deposed he shall be in despite of all


northumberland

thou art deceived tis not thy southern power
of essex norfolk suffolk nor of kent
which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud
can set the duke up in despite of me


clifford

king henry be thy title right or wrong
lord clifford vows to fight in thy defence
may that ground gape and swallow me alive
where i shall kneel to him that slew my father


king henry vi

o clifford how thy words revive my heart


york

henry of lancaster resign thy crown
what mutter you or what conspire you lords


warwick

do right unto this princely duke of york
or i will fill the house with armed men
and over the chair of state where now he sits
write up his title with usurping blood
he stamps with his foot and the soldiers show themselves


king henry vi

my lord of warwick hear me but one word
let me for this my life-time reign as king


york

confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs
and thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest

clifford

in dreadful war mayst thou be overcome
or live in peace abandon and despised
exeunt northumberland clifford and westmoreland


warwick

exeter

they seek revenge and therefore will not yield


king henry vi

ah exeter


warwick

king henry vi

not for myself lord warwick but my son
whom i unnaturally shall disinherit
but be it as it may i here entail
the crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever
conditionally that here thou take an oath
to cease this civil war and whilst i live
to honour me as thy king and sovereign
and neither by treason nor hostility
to seek to put me down and reign thyself


york

this oath i willingly take and will perform


warwick

exeter

here comes the queen whose looks bewray her anger
ill steal away


king henry vi

exeter so will i


queen margaret

nay go not from me i will follow thee


king henry vi

be patient gentle queen and i will stay


queen margaret

who can be patient in such extremes
ah wretched man would i had died a maid
and never seen thee never borne thee son
seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus
hadst thou but loved him half so well as i
or felt that pain which i did for him once
or nourish him as i did with my blood
thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there
rather than have that savage duke thine heir
and disinherited thine only son


prince edward

father you cannot disinherit me
if you be king why should not i succeed


king henry vi

pardon me margaret pardon me sweet son
the earl of warwick and the duke enforced me


queen margaret

enforced thee art thou king and wilt be forced
i shame to hear thee speak ah timorous wretch
thou hast undone thyself thy son and me
and given unto the house of york such head
as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance
to entail him and his heirs unto the crown
what is it but to make thy sepulchre
and creep into it far before thy time
warwick is chancellor and the lord of calais
stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas
the duke is made protector of the realm
and yet shalt thou be safe such safety finds
the trembling lamb environed with wolves
had i been there which am a silly woman
the soldiers should have toss me on their pikes
before i would have granted to that act
but thou preferr thy life before thine honour
and seeing thou dost i here divorce myself
both from thy table henry and thy bed
until that act of parliament be repeal
whereby my son is disinherited
the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
will follow mine if once they see them spread
and spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace
and utter ruin of the house of york
thus do i leave thee come son let away
our army is ready come well after them


king henry vi

stay gentle margaret and hear me speak


queen margaret

thou hast spoke too much already get thee gone


king henry vi

gentle son edward thou wilt stay with me


queen margaret

ill see your grace till then ill follow her


queen margaret

come son away we may not linger thus
exeunt queen margaret and prince edward


king henry vi

poor queen how love to me and to her son
hath made her break out into terms of rage
revenged may she be on that hateful duke
whose haughty spirit winged with desire
will cost my crown and like an empty eagle
tire on the flesh of me and of my son
the loss of those three lords torments my heart
ill write unto them and entreat them fair
come cousin you shall be the messenger


exeter

and i i hope shall reconcile them all

scene ii sandal castle

enter richard edward and montague


richard

brother though i be youngest give me leave


edward

no i can better play the orator


montague

enter york


york

why how now sons and brother at a strife
what is your quarrel how began it first


edward

no quarrel but a slight contention


york

about what


richard

about that which concerns your grace and us
the crown of england father which is yours


york

mine boy not till king henry be dead


richard

your right depends not on his life or death


edward

now you are heir therefore enjoy it now
by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe
it will outrun you father in the end


york

i took an oath that he should quietly reign


edward

but for a kingdom any oath may be broken
i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year


richard

no god forbid your grace should be forsworn


york

i shall be if i claim by open war


richard

ill prove the contrary if youll hear me speak


york

thou canst not son it is impossible


richard

an oath is of no moment being not took
before a true and lawful magistrate
that hath authority over him that swears
henry had none but did usurp the place
then seeing twas he that made you to depose
your oath my lord is vain and frivolous
therefore to arms and father do but think
how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown
within whose circuit is elysium
and all that poets feign of bliss and joy
why do we finger thus i cannot rest
until the white rose that i wear be dyed
even in the lukewarm blood of henry heart


york

richard enough i will be king or die
brother thou shalt to london presently
and whet on warwick to this enterprise
thou richard shalt to the duke of norfolk
and tell him privily of our intent
you edward shall unto my lord cobham
with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise
in them i trust for they are soldiers
witty courteous liberal full of spirit
while you are thus employ what resteth more
but that i seek occasion how to rise
and yet the king not privy to my drift
nor any of the house of lancaster

richard

a woman general what should we fear
a march afar off


edward

i hear their drums let set our men in order
and issue forth and bid them battle straight


york

five men to twenty though the odds be great
i doubt not uncle of our victory
many a battle have i won in france

rutland

clifford

as for the brat of this accursed duke
whose father slew my father he shall die


tutor

and i my lord will bear him company


clifford

soldiers away with him


tutor

ah clifford murder not this innocent child
lest thou be hated both of god and man
exit dragged off by soldiers


clifford

how now is he dead already or is it fear
that makes him close his eyes ill open them


rutland

so looks the pent-up lion oer the wretch
that trembles under his devouring paws
and so he walks insulting oer his prey
and so he comes to rend his limbs asunder
ah gentle clifford kill me with thy sword
and not with such a cruel threatening look
sweet clifford hear me speak before i die
i am too mean a subject for thy wrath
be thou revenged on men and let me live


clifford

in vain thou speak poor boy my father blood
hath stopp the passage where thy words should enter


rutland

then let my father blood open it again
he is a man and clifford cope with him


clifford

had thy brethren here their lives and thine
were not revenge sufficient for me
no if i digg up thy forefathers graves
and hung their rotten coffins up in chains
it could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart
the sight of any of the house of york
is as a fury to torment my soul
and till i root out their accursed line
and leave not one alive i live in hell
therefore 
lifting his hand


rutland

o let me pray before i take my death
to thee i pray sweet clifford pity me


clifford

such pity as my rapier point affords


rutland

i never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me


clifford

thy father hath


rutland

but twas ere i was born
thou hast one son for his sake pity me
lest in revenge thereof sith god is just
he be as miserably slain as i
ah let me live in prison all my days
and when i give occasion of offence
then let me die for now thou hast no cause


clifford

no cause
thy father slew my father therefore die
stabs him


rutland

di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae
dies


clifford

plantagenet i come plantagenet
and this thy son blood cleaving to my blade
shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood
congeal with this do make me wipe off both
exit

scene iv another part of the field

alarum enter york


york

the army of the queen hath got the field
my uncles both are slain in rescuing me
and all my followers to the eager foe
turn back and fly like ships before the wind
or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves
my sons god knows what hath bechanced them
but this i know they have demean themselves
like men born to renown by life or death
three times did richard make a lane to me
and thrice cried courage father fight it out
and full as oft came edward to my side
with purple falchion painted to the hilt
in blood of those that had encounter him
and when the hardiest warriors did retire
richard cried charge and give no foot of ground
and cried a crown or else a glorious tomb
a sceptre or an earthly sepulchre
with this we charged again but out alas
we bodged again as i have seen a swan
with bootless labour swim against the tide
and spend her strength with over-matching waves
a short alarum within
ah hark the fatal followers do pursue
and i am faint and cannot fly their fury
and were i strong i would not shun their fury
the sands are number that make up my life
here must i stay and here my life must end
enter queen margaret clifford northumberland prince edward and soldiers
come bloody clifford rough northumberland
i dare your quenchless fury to more rage
i am your butt and i abide your shot


northumberland

yield to our mercy proud plantagenet


clifford

ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm
with downright payment show unto my father
now phaethon hath tumbled from his car
and made an evening at the noontide prick


york

my ashes as the phoenix may bring forth
a bird that will revenge upon you all
and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven
scorning whateer you can afflict me with
why come you not what multitudes and fear


clifford

so cowards fight when they can fly no further
so doves do peck the falcon piercing talons
so desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives
breathe out invectives gainst the officers


york

o clifford but bethink thee once again
and in thy thought oer-run my former time
and if though canst for blushing view this face
and bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice
whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this


clifford

i will not bandy with thee word for word
but buckle with thee blows twice two for one


queen margaret

hold valiant clifford for a thousand causes
i would prolong awhile the traitor life
wrath makes him deaf speak thou northumberland


northumberland

hold clifford do not honour him so much
to prick thy finger though to wound his heart
what valour were it when a cur doth grin
for one to thrust his hand between his teeth
when he might spurn him with his foot away
it is war prize to take all vantages
and ten to one is no impeach of valour
they lay hands on york who struggles


clifford

ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin


northumberland

so doth the cony struggle in the net


york

so triumph thieves upon their conquer booty
so true men yield with robbers so oermatch


northumberland

what would your grace have done unto him now


queen margaret

brave warriors clifford and northumberland
come make him stand upon this molehill here
that raught at mountains with outstretched arms
yet parted but the shadow with his hand
what was it you that would be england king
wast you that revell in our parliament
and made a preachment of your high descent
where are your mess of sons to back you now
the wanton edward and the lusty george
and where that valiant crook-back prodigy
dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice
was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies
or with the rest where is your darling rutland
look york i stain this napkin with the blood
that valiant clifford with his rapier point
made issue from the bosom of the boy
and if thine eyes can water for his death
i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal
alas poor york but that i hate thee deadly
i should lament thy miserable state
i prithee grieve to make me merry york
what hath thy fiery heart so parch thine entrails
that not a tear can fall for rutland death
why art thou patient man thou shouldst be mad
and i to make thee mad do mock thee thus
stamp rave and fret that i may sing and dance
thou wouldst be fee i see to make me sport
york cannot speak unless he wear a crown
a crown for york and lords bow low to him
hold you his hands whilst i do set it on
putting a paper crown on his head
ay marry sir now looks he like a king
ay this is he that took king henry chair
and this is he was his adopted heir
but how is it that great plantagenet
is crown so soon and broke his solemn oath
as i bethink me you should not be king
till our king henry had shook hands with death
and will you pale your head in henry glory
and rob his temples of the diadem
now in his life against your holy oath
o tis a fault too too unpardonable
off with the crown and with the crown his head
and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead


clifford

that is my office for my father sake


queen margaret

nay stay lets hear the orisons he makes


york

she-wolf of france but worse than wolves of france
whose tongue more poisons than the adder tooth
how ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
to triumph like an amazonian trull
upon their woes whom fortune captivates
but that thy face is vizard-like unchanging
made impudent with use of evil deeds
i would assay proud queen to make thee blush
to tell thee whence thou camest of whom derived
were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless
thy father bears the type of king of naples
of both the sicils and jerusalem
yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman
hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult
it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen
unless the adage must be verified
that beggars mounted run their horse to death
tis beauty that doth oft make women proud
but god he knows thy share thereof is small
tis virtue that doth make them most admired
the contrary doth make thee wonder at
tis government that makes them seem divine
the want thereof makes thee abominable
thou art as opposite to every good
as the antipodes are unto us
or as the south to the septentrion
o tiger heart wrapt in a woman hide
how couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child
to bid the father wipe his eyes withal
and yet be seen to bear a woman face
women are soft mild pitiful and flexible
thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless
bidst thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish
wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will
for raging wind blows up incessant showers
and when the rage allays the rain begins
these tears are my sweet rutland obsequies
and every drop cries vengeance for his death
gainst thee fell clifford and thee false
frenchwoman


northumberland

beshrew me but his passion moves me so
that hardly can i cheque my eyes from tears


york

that face of his the hungry cannibals
would not have touch would not have stain with blood
but you are more inhuman more inexorable
o ten times more than tigers of hyrcania
see ruthless queen a hapless father tears
this cloth thou dipst in blood of my sweet boy
and i with tears do wash the blood away
keep thou the napkin and go boast of this
and if thou tell the heavy story right
upon my soul the hearers will shed tears
yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears
and say alas it was a piteous deed
there take the crown and with the crown my curse
and in thy need such comfort come to thee
as now i reap at thy too cruel hand
hard-hearted clifford take me from the world
my soul to heaven my blood upon your heads


northumberland

had he been slaughter-man to all my kin
i should not for my life but weep with him
to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul


queen margaret

what weeping-ripe my lord northumberland
think but upon the wrong he did us all
and that will quickly dry thy melting tears


clifford

here for my oath here for my father death
stabbing him


queen margaret

and here to right our gentle-hearted king
stabbing him


york

open thy gate of mercy gracious god
my soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee
dies


queen margaret

off with his head and set it on york gates
so york may overlook the town of york
flourish exeunt

act ii
scene i a plain near mortimer cross in herefordshire

a march enter edward richard and their power


edward

i wonder how our princely father caped
or whether he be caped away or no
from clifford and northumberland pursuit
had he been taen we should have heard the news
had he been slain we should have heard the news
or had he caped methinks we should have heard
the happy tidings of his good escape
how fares my brother why is he so sad


richard

i cannot joy until i be resolved
where our right valiant father is become
i saw him in the battle range about
and watch him how he singled clifford forth
methought he bore him in the thickest troop
as doth a lion in a herd of neat
or as a bear encompass round with dogs
who having pinch a few and made them cry
the rest stand all aloof and bark at him
so fared our father with his enemies
so fled his enemies my warlike father
methinks tis prize enough to be his son
see how the morning opes her golden gates
and takes her farewell of the glorious sun
how well resembles it the prime of youth
trimm like a younker prancing to his love


edward

dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns


richard

three glorious suns each one a perfect sun
not separated with the racking clouds
but sever in a pale clear-shining sky
see see they join embrace and seem to kiss
as if they vow some league inviolable
now are they but one lamp one light one sun
in this the heaven figures some event


edward

tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of
i think it cites us brother to the field
that we the sons of brave plantagenet
each one already blazing by our meeds
should notwithstanding join our lights together
and over-shine the earth as this the world
whateer it bodes henceforward will i bear
upon my target three fair-shining suns


richard

nay bear three daughters by your leave i speak it
you love the breeder better than the male
enter a messenger
but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell
some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue


messenger

ah one that was a woful looker-on
when as the noble duke of york was slain
your princely father and my loving lord


edward

o speak no more for i have heard too much


richard

say how he died for i will hear it all


messenger

environed he was with many foes
and stood against them as the hope of troy
against the greeks that would have enter troy
but hercules himself must yield to odds
and many strokes though with a little axe
hew down and fell the hardest-timber oak
by many hands your father was subdued
but only slaughter by the ireful arm
of unrelenting clifford and the queen
who crown the gracious duke in high despite
laugh in his face and when with grief he wept
the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
a napkin steeped in the harmless blood
of sweet young rutland by rough clifford slain
and after many scorns many foul taunts
they took his head and on the gates of york
they set the same and there it doth remain
the saddest spectacle that eer i view


edward

sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon
now thou art gone we have no staff no stay
o clifford boisterous clifford thou hast slain
the flower of europe for his chivalry
and treacherously hast thou vanquish him
for hand to hand he would have vanquish thee
now my soul palace is become a prison
ah would she break from hence that this my body
might in the ground be closed up in rest
for never henceforth shall i joy again
never o never shall i see more joy


richard

i cannot weep for all my body moisture
scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart
nor can my tongue unload my heart great burthen
for selfsame wind that i should speak withal
is kindling coals that fires all my breast
and burns me up with flames that tears would quench
to weep is to make less the depth of grief
tears then for babes blows and revenge for me
richard i bear thy name ill venge thy death
or die renowned by attempting it


edward

his name that valiant duke hath left with thee
his dukedom and his chair with me is left


richard

nay if thou be that princely eagle bird
show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun
for chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say
either that is thine or else thou wert not his
march enter warwick montague and their army


warwick

how now fair lords what fare what news abroad


richard

great lord of warwick if we should recount
our baleful news and at each word deliverance
stab poniards in our flesh till all were told
the words would add more anguish than the wounds
o valiant lord the duke of york is slain


edward

o warwick warwick that plantagenet
which held three dearly as his soul redemption
is by the stern lord clifford done to death


warwick

ten days ago i drown these news in tears
and now to add more measure to your woes
i come to tell you things sith then befalln
after the bloody fray at wakefield fought
where your brave father breathed his latest gasp
tidings as swiftly as the posts could run
were brought me of your loss and his depart
i then in london keeper of the king
muster my soldiers gather flocks of friends
and very well appointed as i thought
march toward saint alban to intercept the queen
bearing the king in my behalf along
for by my scouts i was advertised
that she was coming with a full intent
to dash our late decree in parliament
touching king henry oath and your succession
short tale to make we at saint alban met
our battles join and both sides fiercely fought
but whether twas the coldness of the king
who look full gently on his warlike queen
that robb my soldiers of their heated spleen
or whether twas report of her success
or more than common fear of clifford rigour
who thunders to his captives blood and death
i cannot judge but to conclude with truth
their weapons like to lightning came and went
our soldiers like the night-owl lazy flight
or like an idle thresher with a flail
fell gently down as if they struck their friends
i cheer them up with justice of our cause
with promise of high pay and great rewards
but all in vain they had no heart to fight
and we in them no hope to win the day
so that we fled the king unto the queen
lord george your brother norfolk and myself
in haste post-haste are come to join with you
for in the marches here we heard you were
making another head to fight again


edward

where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick
and when came george from burgundy to england


warwick

some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers
and for your brother he was lately sent
from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy
with aid of soldiers to this needful war


richard

twas odds belike when valiant warwick fled
oft have i heard his praises in pursuit
but neer till now his scandal of retire


warwick

nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear
for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
can pluck the diadem from faint henry head
and wring the awful sceptre from his fist
were he as famous and as bold in war
as he is famed for mildness peace and prayer


richard

i know it well lord warwick blame me not
tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak
but in this troublous time what to be done
shall we go throw away our coats of steel
and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns
numbering our ave-maries with our beads
or shall we on the helmets of our foes
tell our devotion with revengeful arms
if for the last say ay and to it lords


warwick

why therefore warwick came to seek you out
and therefore comes my brother montague
attend me lords the proud insulting queen
with clifford and the haught northumberland
and of their feather many more proud birds
have wrought the easy-melting king like wax
he swore consent to your succession
his oath enrolled in the parliament
and now to london all the crew are gone
to frustrate both his oath and what beside
may make against the house of lancaster
their power i think is thirty thousand strong
now if the help of norfolk and myself
with all the friends that thou brave earl of march
amongst the loving welshmen canst procure
will but amount to five and twenty thousand
why via to london will we march amain
and once again bestride our foaming steeds
and once again cry charge upon our foes
but never once again turn back and fly


richard

ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak
neer may he live to see a sunshine day
that cries retire if warwick bid him stay


edward

lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean
and when thou fail as god forbid the hour 
must edward fall which peril heaven forfend


warwick

no longer earl of march but duke of york
the next degree is england royal throne
for king of england shalt thou be proclaim
in every borough as we pass along
and he that throws not up his cap for joy
shall for the fault make forfeit of his head
king edward valiant richard montague
stay we no longer dreaming of renown
but sound the trumpets and about our task


richard

then clifford were thy heart as hard as steel
as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds
i come to pierce it or to give thee mine


edward

then strike up drums god and saint george for us
enter a messenger


warwick

how now what news


messenger

the duke of norfolk sends you word by me
the queen is coming with a puissant host
and craves your company for speedy counsel


warwick

why then it sorts brave warriors let away

scene ii before york

flourish enter king henry vi queen margaret  prince edward clifford and northumberland with drum and trumpets


queen margaret

welcome my lord to this brave town of york
yonder the head of that arch-enemy
that sought to be encompass with your crown
doth not the object cheer your heart my lord


king henry vi

ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck
to see this sight it irks my very soul
withhold revenge dear god tis not my fault
nor wittingly have i infringed my vow


clifford

my gracious liege this too much lenity
and harmful pity must be laid aside
to whom do lions cast their gentle looks
not to the beast that would usurp their den
whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick
not his that spoils her young before her face
who capes the lurking serpent mortal sting
not he that sets his foot upon her back
the smallest worm will turn being trodden on
and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood
ambitious york doth level at thy crown
thou smiling while he knit his angry brows
he but a duke would have his son a king
and raise his issue like a loving sire
thou being a king blest with a goodly son
didst yield consent to disinherit him
which argued thee a most unloving father
unreasonable creatures feed their young
and though man face be fearful to their eyes
yet in protection of their tender ones
who hath not seen them even with those wings
which sometime they have used with fearful flight
make war with him that climb unto their nest
offer their own lives in their young defence
for shame my liege make them your precedent
were it not pity that this goodly boy
should lose his birthright by his father fault
and long hereafter say unto his child
what my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
my careless father fondly gave away
ah what a shame were this look on the boy
and let his manly face which promiseth
successful fortune steel thy melting heart
to hold thine own and leave thine own with him


king henry vi

full well hath clifford play the orator
inferring arguments of mighty force
but clifford tell me didst thou never hear
that things ill-got had ever bad success
and happy always was it for that son
whose father for his hoarding went to hell
ill leave my son my virtuous deeds behind
and would my father had left me no more
for all the rest is held at such a rate
as brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
than in possession and jot of pleasure
ah cousin york would thy best friends did know
how it doth grieve me that thy head is here


queen margaret

my lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh
and this soft courage makes your followers faint
you promised knighthood to our forward son
unsheathe your sword and dub him presently
edward kneel down


king henry vi

edward plantagenet arise a knight
and learn this lesson draw thy sword in right


prince

my gracious father by your kingly leave
ill draw it as apparent to the crown
and in that quarrel use it to the death


clifford

why that is spoken like a toward prince
enter a messenger


messenger

royal commanders be in readiness
for with a band of thirty thousand men
comes warwick backing of the duke of york
and in the towns as they do march along
proclaims him king and many fly to him
darraign your battle for they are at hand


clifford

i would your highness would depart the field
the queen hath best success when you are absent


queen margaret

king henry vi

edward

now perjured henry wilt thou kneel for grace
and set thy diadem upon my head
or bide the mortal fortune of the field


queen margaret

go rate thy minions proud insulting boy
becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
before thy sovereign and thy lawful king


edward

i am his king and he should bow his knee
i was adopted heir by his consent
since when his oath is broke for as i hear
you that are king though he do wear the crown
have caused him by new act of parliament
to blot out me and put his own son in


clifford

and reason too
who should succeed the father but the son


richard

are you there butcher o i cannot speak


clifford

ay crook-back here i stand to answer thee
or any he the proudest of thy sort


richard

twas you that kill young rutland was it not


clifford

ay and old york and yet not satisfied


richard

for god sake lords give signal to the fight


warwick

what say thou henry wilt thou yield the crown


queen margaret

why how now long-tongued warwick dare you speak
when you and i met at saint alban last
your legs did better service than your hands


warwick

then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine


clifford

you said so much before and yet you fled


warwick

twas not your valour clifford drove me thence


northumberland

no nor your manhood that durst make you stay


richard

northumberland i hold thee reverently
break off the parley for scarce i can refrain
the execution of my big-swoln heart
upon that clifford that cruel child-killer


clifford

i slew thy father call thou him a child


richard

ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward
as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland
but ere sunset ill make thee curse the deed


king henry vi

have done with words my lords and hear me speak


queen margaret

defy them then or else hold close thy lips


king henry vi

i prithee give no limits to my tongue
i am a king and privileged to speak


clifford

my liege the wound that bred this meeting here
cannot be cured by words therefore be still


richard

then executioner unsheathe thy sword
by him that made us all i am resolved
that clifford manhood lies upon his tongue


edward

say henry shall i have my right or no
a thousand men have broke their fasts to-day
that neer shall dine unless thou yield the crown


warwick

if thou deny their blood upon thy head
for york in justice puts his armour on


prince edward

if that be right which warwick says is right
there is no wrong but every thing is right


richard

whoever got thee there thy mother stands
for well i wot thou hast thy mother tongue


queen margaret

but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam
but like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic
mark by the destinies to be avoided
as venom toads or lizards dreadful stings


richard

iron of naples hid with english gilt
whose father bears the title of a king 
as if a channel should be call the sea 
shamest thou not knowing whence thou art extraught
to let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart


edward

a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
to make this shameless callet know herself
helen of greece was fairer far than thou
although thy husband may be menelaus
and neer was agamemnon brother wrong
by that false woman as this king by thee
his father revell in the heart of france
and tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop
and had he match according to his state
he might have kept that glory to this day
but when he took a beggar to his bed
and graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day
even then that sunshine brew a shower for him
that wash his father fortunes forth of france
and heap sedition on his crown at home
for what hath broach this tumult but thy pride
hadst thou been meek our title still had slept
and we in pity of the gentle king
had slipp our claim until another age


george

but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring
and that thy summer bred us no increase
we set the axe to thy usurping root
and though the edge hath something hit ourselves
yet know thou since we have begun to strike
well never leave till we have hewn thee down
or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods


edward

and in this resolution i defy thee
not willing any longer conference
since thou deniest the gentle king to speak
sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave
and either victory or else a grave


queen margaret

stay edward


edward

no wrangling woman well no longer stay
these words will cost ten thousand lives this day

for strokes received and many blows repaid

and spite of spite needs must i rest awhile

edward

bootless is flight they follow us with wings
and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit
enter richard


richard

ah warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself
thy brother blood the thirsty earth hath drunk
broach with the steely point of clifford lance
and in the very pangs of death he cried
like to a dismal clangour heard from far
warwick revenge brother revenge my death
so underneath the belly of their steeds
that stain their fetlocks in his smoking blood
the noble gentleman gave up the ghost


warwick

then let the earth be drunken with our blood
ill kill my horse because i will not fly
why stand we like soft-hearted women here
wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage
and look upon as if the tragedy
were play in jest by counterfeiting actors
here on my knee i vow to god above
ill never pause again never stand still
till either death hath closed these eyes of mine
or fortune given me measure of revenge


edward

o warwick i do bend my knee with thine
and in this vow do chain my soul to thine
and ere my knee rise from the earth cold face
i throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee
thou setter up and plucker down of kings
beseeching thee if with they will it stands
that to my foes this body must be prey
yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope
and give sweet passage to my sinful soul
now lords take leave until we meet again
whereer it be in heaven or in earth


richard

brother give me thy hand and gentle warwick
let me embrace thee in my weary arms
i that did never weep now melt with woe
that winter should cut off our spring-time so


warwick

away away once more sweet lords farewell


george

yet let us all together to our troops
and give them leave to fly that will not stay
and call them pillars that will stand to us
and if we thrive promise them such rewards
as victors wear at the olympian games
this may plant courage in their quailing breasts
for yet is hope of life and victory
forslow no longer make we hence amain

scene v another part of the field

alarum enter king henry vi alone


king henry vi

this battle fares like to the morning war
when dying clouds contend with growing light
what time the shepherd blowing of his nails
can neither call it perfect day nor night
now sways it this way like a mighty sea
forced by the tide to combat with the wind
now sways it that way like the selfsame sea
forced to retire by fury of the wind
sometime the flood prevails and then the wind
now one the better then another best
both tugging to be victors breast to breast
yet neither conqueror nor conquered
so is the equal of this fell war
here on this molehill will i sit me down
to whom god will there be the victory
for margaret my queen and clifford too
have chid me from the battle swearing both
they prosper best of all when i am thence
would i were dead if god good will were so
for what is in this world but grief and woe
o god methinks it were a happy life
to be no better than a homely swain
to sit upon a hill as i do now
to carve out dials quaintly point by point
thereby to see the minutes how they run
how many make the hour full complete
how many hours bring about the day
how many days will finish up the year
how many years a mortal man may live
when this is known then to divide the times
so many hours must i tend my flock
so many hours must i take my rest
so many hours must i contemplate
so many hours must i sport myself
so many days my ewes have been with young
so many weeks ere the poor fools will ean
so many years ere i shall shear the fleece
so minutes hours days months and years
pass over to the end they were created
would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave
ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely
gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
to shepherds looking on their silly sheep
than doth a rich embroider canopy
to kings that fear their subjects treachery
o yes it doth a thousand-fold it doth
and to conclude the shepherd homely curds
his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle
his wonted sleep under a fresh tree shade
all which secure and sweetly he enjoys
is far beyond a prince delicates
his viands sparkling in a golden cup
his body couched in a curious bed
when care mistrust and treason waits on him
alarum enter a son that has killed his father dragging in the dead body


son

ill blows the wind that profits nobody
this man whom hand to hand i slew in fight
may be possessed with some store of crowns
and i that haply take them from him now
may yet ere night yield both my life and them
to some man else as this dead man doth me
who this o god it is my father face
whom in this conflict i unwares have kill
o heavy times begetting such events
from london by the king was i press forth
my father being the earl of warwick man
came on the part of york press by his master
and i who at his hands received my life him
have by my hands of life bereaved him
pardon me god i knew not what i did
and pardon father for i knew not thee
my tears shall wipe away these bloody marks
and no more words till they have flow their fill


king henry vi

o piteous spectacle o bloody times
whiles lions war and battle for their dens
poor harmless lambs abide their enmity
weep wretched man ill aid thee tear for tear
and let our hearts and eyes like civil war
be blind with tears and break oercharged with grief
enter a father that has killed his son bringing in the body


father

thou that so stoutly hast resisted me
give me thy gold if thou hast any gold
for i have bought it with an hundred blows
but let me see is this our foeman face
ah no no no it is mine only son
ah boy if any life be left in thee
throw up thine eye see see what showers arise
blown with the windy tempest of my heart
upon thy words that kill mine eye and heart
o pity god this miserable age
what stratagems how fell how butcherly
erroneous mutinous and unnatural
this deadly quarrel daily doth beget
o boy thy father gave thee life too soon
and hath bereft thee of thy life too late


king henry vi

woe above woe grief more than common grief
o that my death would stay these ruthful deeds
o pity pity gentle heaven pity
the red rose and the white are on his face
the fatal colours of our striving houses
the one his purple blood right well resembles
the other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth
wither one rose and let the other flourish
if you contend a thousand lives must wither


son

how will my mother for a father death
take on with me and neer be satisfied


father

how will my wife for slaughter of my son
shed seas of tears and neer be satisfied


king henry vi

how will the country for these woful chances
misthink the king and not be satisfied

much is your sorrow mine ten times so much


son

ill bear thee hence where i may weep my fill
exit with the body


father

these arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet
my heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre
for from my heart thine image neer shall go
my sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell
and so obsequious will thy father be
even for the loss of thee having no more
as priam was for all his valiant sons
ill bear thee hence and let them fight that will

scene vi another part of the field

a loud alarum enter clifford wounded


clifford

here burns my candle out ay here it dies
which whiles it lasted gave king henry light
o lancaster i fear thy overthrow
more than my body parting with my soul
my love and fear glued many friends to thee
and now i fall thy tough commixture melts
impairing henry strengthening misproud york
the common people swarm like summer flies
and whither fly the gnats but to the sun
and who shines now but henry enemies
o phoebus hadst thou never given consent
that phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds
thy burning car never had scorch the earth
and henry hadst thou sway as kings should do
or as thy father and his father did
giving no ground unto the house of york
they never then had sprung like summer flies
i and ten thousand in this luckless realm
had left no mourning widows for our death
and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace
for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air
and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity
bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds
no way to fly nor strength to hold out flight
the foe is merciless and will not pity
for at their hands i have deserved no pity
the air hath got into my deadly wounds
and much effuse of blood doth make me faint
come york and richard warwick and the rest
i stabb your fathers bosoms split my breast
he faints
alarum and retreat enter edward george richard montague warwick and soldiers


edward

now breathe we lords good fortune bids us pause
and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks
some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen
that led calm henry though he were a king
as doth a sail fill with a fretting gust
command an argosy to stem the waves
but think you lords that clifford fled with them


warwick

no tis impossible he should escape
for though before his face i speak the words
your brother richard mark him for the grave
and wheresoeer he is he surely dead
clifford groans and dies


edward

whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave


richard

a deadly groan like life and death departing


edward

see who it is and now the battle ended
if friend or foe let him be gently used


richard

revoke that doom of mercy for tis clifford
who not contented that he lopp the branch
in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth
but set his murdering knife unto the root
from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring
i mean our princely father duke of york


warwick

from off the gates of york fetch down the head
your father head which clifford placed there
instead whereof let this supply the room
measure for measure must be answered


edward

bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house
that nothing sung but death to us and ours
now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound
and his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak


warwick

i think his understanding is bereft
speak clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee
dark cloudy death oershades his beams of life
and he nor sees nor hears us what we say


richard

o would he did and so perhaps he doth
tis but his policy to counterfeit
because he would avoid such bitter taunts
which in the time of death he gave our father


george

if so thou think vex him with eager words


richard

clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace


edward

clifford repent in bootless penitence


warwick

clifford devise excuses for thy faults


george

while we devise fell tortures for thy faults


richard

thou didst love york and i am son to york


edward

thou pitied rutland i will pity thee


george

where captain margaret to fence you now


warwick

they mock thee clifford swear as thou wast wont


richard

what not an oath nay then the world goes hard
when clifford cannot spare his friends an oath
i know by that he dead and by my soul
if this right hand would buy two hour life
that i in all despite might rail at him
this hand should chop it off and with the
issuing blood
stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
york and young rutland could not satisfy


warwick

ay but he dead off with the traitor head
and rear it in the place your father stands
and now to london with triumphant march
there to be crowned england royal king
from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france
and ask the lady bona for thy queen
so shalt thou sinew both these lands together
and having france thy friend thou shalt not dread
the scatter foe that hopes to rise again
for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt
yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears
first will i see the coronation
and then to brittany ill cross the sea
to effect this marriage so it please my lord


edward

even as thou wilt sweet warwick let it be
for in thy shoulder do i build my seat
and never will i undertake the thing
wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting
richard i will create thee duke of gloucester
and george of clarence warwick as ourself
shall do and undo as him pleaseth best


richard

let me be duke of clarence george of gloucester
for gloucester dukedom is too ominous

and in this covert will we make our stand
culling the principal of all the deer


second keeper

ill stay above the hill so both may shoot


first keeper

that cannot be the noise of thy cross-bow
will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost
here stand we both and aim we at the best
and for the time shall not seem tedious
ill tell thee what befell me on a day
in this self-place where now we mean to stand


second keeper

here comes a man let stay till he be past
enter king henry vi disguised with a prayerbook


king henry vi

from scotland am i stoln even of pure love
to greet mine own land with my wishful sight
no harry harry tis no land of thine
thy place is fill thy sceptre wrung from thee
thy balm wash off wherewith thou wast anointed
no bending knee will call thee caesar now
no humble suitors press to speak for right
no not a man comes for redress of thee
for how can i help them and not myself


first keeper

ay here a deer whose skin a keeper fee
this is the quondam king let seize upon him


king henry vi

let me embrace thee sour adversity
for wise men say it is the wisest course


second keeper

why linger we let us lay hands upon him


first keeper

forbear awhile well hear a little more


king henry vi

my queen and son are gone to france for aid
and as i hear the great commanding warwick
is thither gone to crave the french king sister
to wife for edward if this news be true
poor queen and son your labour is but lost
for warwick is a subtle orator
and lewis a prince soon won with moving words
by this account then margaret may win him
for she a woman to be pitied much
her sighs will make a battery in his breast
her tears will pierce into a marble heart
the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn
and nero will be tainted with remorse
to hear and see her plaints her brinish tears
ay but she come to beg warwick to give
she on his left side craving aid for henry
he on his right asking a wife for edward
she weeps and says her henry is deposed
he smiles and says his edward is install
that she poor wretch for grief can speak no more
whiles warwick tells his title smooths the wrong
inferreth arguments of mighty strength
and in conclusion wins the king from her
with promise of his sister and what else
to strengthen and support king edward place
o margaret thus twill be and thou poor soul
art then forsaken as thou went forlorn


second keeper

say what art thou that talk of kings and queens


king henry vi

more than i seem and less than i was born to
a man at least for less i should not be
and men may talk of kings and why not i


second keeper

ay but thou talk as if thou wert a king


king henry vi

why so i am in mind and that enough


second keeper

but if thou be a king where is thy crown


king henry vi

my crown is in my heart not on my head
not decked with diamonds and indian stones
nor to be seen my crown is called content
a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy


second keeper

well if you be a king crown with content
your crown content and you must be contented
to go along with us for as we think
you are the king king edward hath deposed
and we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
will apprehend you as his enemy


king henry vi

but did you never swear and break an oath


second keeper

no never such an oath nor will not now


king henry vi

where did you dwell when i was king of england


second keeper

here in this country where we now remain


king henry vi

i was anointed king at nine months old
my father and my grandfather were kings
and you were sworn true subjects unto me
and tell me then have you not broke your oaths


first keeper

no
for we were subjects but while you were king


king henry vi

why am i dead do i not breathe a man
ah simple men you know not what you swear
look as i blow this feather from my face
and as the air blows it to me again
obeying with my wind when i do blow
and yielding to another when it blows
commanded always by the greater gust
such is the lightness of you common men
but do not break your oaths for of that sin
my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty
go where you will the king shall be commanded
and be you kings command and ill obey


first keeper

we are true subjects to the king king edward


king henry vi

so would you be again to henry
if he were seated as king edward is


first keeper

we charge you in god name and the king
to go with us unto the officers


king henry vi

in god name lead your king name be obey
and what god will that let your king perform
and what he will i humbly yield unto

herein your highness wrongs both them and me
but mighty lord this merry inclination
accords not with the sadness of my suit
please you dismiss me either with ay or no


king edward iv

ay if thou wilt say ay to my request
no if thou dost say no to my demand


lady grey

then no my lord my suit is at an end


gloucester

aside to clarence  the widow likes him not she
knits her brows


clarence

aside to gloucester  he is the bluntest wooer in
christendom


king edward iv

aside  her looks do argue her replete with modesty
her words do show her wit incomparable
all her perfections challenge sovereignty
one way or other she is for a king
and she shall be my love or else my queen 
say that king edward take thee for his queen


lady grey

tis better said than done my gracious lord
i am a subject fit to jest withal
but far unfit to be a sovereign


king edward iv

sweet widow by my state i swear to thee
i speak no more than what my soul intends
and that is to enjoy thee for my love


lady grey

and that is more than i will yield unto
i know i am too mean to be your queen
and yet too good to be your concubine


king edward iv

you cavil widow i did mean my queen


lady grey

twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father


king edward iv

no more than when my daughters call thee mother
thou art a widow and thou hast some children
and by god mother i being but a bachelor
have other some why tis a happy thing
to be the father unto many sons
answer no more for thou shalt be my queen


gloucester

aside to clarence  the ghostly father now hath done
his shrift


clarence

aside to gloucester  when he was made a shriver
twas for shift


king edward iv

brothers you muse what chat we two have had


gloucester

the widow likes it not for she looks very sad


king edward iv

youll think it strange if i should marry her


clarence

to whom my lord


king edward iv

why clarence to myself


gloucester

that would be ten days wonder at the least


clarence

that a day longer than a wonder lasts


gloucester

by so much is the wonder in extremes


king edward iv

well jest on brothers i can tell you both
her suit is granted for her husband lands
enter a nobleman


nobleman

my gracious lord henry your foe is taken
and brought your prisoner to your palace gate


king edward iv

see that he be convey unto the tower
and go we brothers to the man that took him
to question of his apprehension
widow go you along lords use her honourably
exeunt all but gloucester


gloucester

ay edward will use women honourably
would he were wasted marrow bones and all
that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring
to cross me from the golden time i look for
and yet between my soul desire and me 
the lustful edward title buried 
is clarence henry and his son young edward
and all the unlook for issue of their bodies
to take their rooms ere i can place myself
a cold premeditation for my purpose
why then i do but dream on sovereignty
like one that stands upon a promontory
and spies a far-off shore where he would tread
wishing his foot were equal with his eye
and chides the sea that sunders him from thence
saying hell lade it dry to have his way
so do i wish the crown being so far off
and so i chide the means that keeps me from it
and so i say ill cut the causes off
flattering me with impossibilities
my eye too quick my heart oerweens too much
unless my hand and strength could equal them
well say there is no kingdom then for richard
what other pleasure can the world afford
ill make my heaven in a lady lap
and deck my body in gay ornaments
and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks
o miserable thought and more unlikely
than to accomplish twenty golden crowns
why love forswore me in my  mother womb
and for i should not deal in her soft laws
she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe
to shrink mine arm up like a wither shrub
to make an envious mountain on my back
where sits deformity to mock my body
to shape my legs of an unequal size
to disproportion me in every part
like to a chaos or an unlick bear-whelp
that carries no impression like the dam
and am i then a man to be beloved
o monstrous fault to harbour such a thought
then since this earth affords no joy to me
but to command to cheque to oerbear such
as are of better person than myself
ill make my heaven to dream upon the crown
and whiles i live to account this world but hell
until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head
be round impaled with a glorious crown
and yet i know not how to get the crown
for many lives stand between me and home
and i like one lost in a thorny wood
that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns
seeking a way and straying from the way
not knowing how to find the open air
but toiling desperately to find it out 
torment myself to catch the english crown
and from that torment i will free myself
or hew my way out with a bloody axe
why i can smile and murder whiles i smile
and cry content to that which grieves my heart
and wet my cheeks with artificial tears
and frame my face to all occasions
ill drown more sailors than the mermaid shall
ill slay more gazers than the basilisk
ill play the orator as well as nestor
deceive more slily than ulysses could
and like a sinon take another troy
i can add colours to the chameleon
change shapes with proteus for advantages
and set the murderous machiavel to school
can i do this and cannot get a crown
tut were it farther off ill pluck it down

scene iii france king lewis xi palace

flourish enter king lewis xi his sister bona  his admiral called bourbon prince edward queen  margaret and oxford king lewis xi sits and riseth up again


king lewis xi

fair queen of england worthy margaret
sit down with us it ill befits thy state
and birth that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit


queen margaret

no mighty king of france now margaret
must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
where kings command i was i must confess
great albion queen in former golden days
but now mischance hath trod my title down
and with dishonour laid me on the ground
where i must take like seat unto my fortune
and to my humble seat conform myself


king lewis xi

why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair


queen margaret

from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
and stops my tongue while heart is drown in cares


king lewis xi

whateer it be be thou still like thyself
and sit thee by our side
seats her by him
yield not thy neck
to fortune yoke but let thy dauntless mind
still ride in triumph over all mischance
be plain queen margaret and tell thy grief
it shall be eased if france can yield relief


queen margaret

those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
and give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak
now therefore be it known to noble lewis
that henry sole possessor of my love
is of a king become a banish man
and forced to live in scotland a forlorn
while proud ambitious edward duke of york
usurps the regal title and the seat
of england true-anointed lawful king
this is the cause that i poor margaret
with this my son prince edward henry heir
am come to crave thy just and lawful aid
and if thou fail us all our hope is done
scotland hath will to help but cannot help
our people and our peers are both misled
our treasures seized our soldiers put to flight
and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight


king lewis xi

renowned queen with patience calm the storm
while we bethink a means to break it off


queen margaret

the more we stay the stronger grows our foe


king lewis xi

the more i stay the more ill succor thee


queen margaret

o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow
and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow
enter warwick


king lewis xi

what he approacheth boldly to our presence


queen margaret

our earl of warwick edward greatest friend


king lewis xi

welcome brave warwick what brings thee to france
he descends she ariseth


queen margaret

ay now begins a second storm to rise
for this is he that moves both wind and tide


warwick

from worthy edward king of albion
my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend
i come in kindness and unfeigned love
first to do greetings to thy royal person
and then to crave a league of amity
and lastly to confirm that amity
with a nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant
that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister
to england king in lawful marriage


queen margaret

aside  if that go forward henry hope is done


warwick

to bona  and gracious madam in our king behalf
i am commanded with your leave and favour
humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue
to tell the passion of my sovereign heart
where fame late entering at his heedful ears
hath placed thy beauty image and thy virtue


queen margaret

king lewis and lady bona hear me speak
before you answer warwick his demand
springs not from edward well-meant honest love
but from deceit bred by necessity
for how can tyrants safely govern home
unless abroad they purchase great alliance
to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice
that henry liveth still but were he dead
yet here prince edward stands king henry son
look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage
thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour
for though usurpers sway the rule awhile
yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs


warwick

injurious margaret


prince edward

and why not queen


warwick

because thy father henry did usurp
and thou no more are prince than she is queen


oxford

then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt
which did subdue the greatest part of spain
and after john of gaunt henry the fourth
whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest
and after that wise prince henry the fifth
who by his prowess conquered all france
from these our henry lineally descends


warwick

oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse
you told not how henry the sixth hath lost
all that which henry fifth had gotten
methinks these peers of france should smile at that
but for the rest you tell a pedigree
of threescore and two years a silly time
to make prescription for a kingdom worth


oxford

why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege
whom thou obeyed thirty and six years
and not bewray thy treason with a blush


warwick

can oxford that did ever fence the right
now buckler falsehood with a pedigree
for shame leave henry and call edward king


oxford

call him my king by whose injurious doom
my elder brother the lord aubrey vere
was done to death and more than so my father
even in the downfall of his mellow years
when nature brought him to the door of death
no warwick no while life upholds this arm
this arm upholds the house of lancaster


warwick

and i the house of york


king lewis xi

queen margaret prince edward and oxford
vouchsafe at our request to stand aside
while i use further conference with warwick
they stand aloof


queen margaret

heavens grant that warwick words bewitch him not


king lewis xi

now warwick tell me even upon thy conscience
is edward your true king for i were loath
to link with him that were not lawful chosen


warwick

thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour


king lewis xi

but is he gracious in the people eye


warwick

the more that henry was unfortunate


king lewis xi

then further all dissembling set aside
tell me for truth the measure of his love
unto our sister bona


warwick

such it seems
as may beseem a monarch like himself
myself have often heard him say and swear
that this his love was an eternal plant
whereof the root was fix in virtue ground
the leaves and fruit maintain with beauty sun
exempt from envy but not from disdain
unless the lady bona quit his pain


king lewis xi

now sister let us hear your firm resolve


bona

your grant or your denial shall be mine
to warwick
yet i confess that often ere this day
when i have heard your king desert recounted
mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire


king lewis xi

then warwick thus our sister shall be edward
and now forthwith shall articles be drawn
touching the jointure that your king must make
which with her dowry shall be counterpoised
draw near queen margaret and be a witness
that bona shall be wife to the english king


prince edward

to edward but not to the english king


queen margaret

deceitful warwick it was thy device
by this alliance to make void my suit
before thy coming lewis was henry friend


king lewis xi

and still is friend to him and margaret
but if your title to the crown be weak
as may appear by edward good success
then tis but reason that i be released
from giving aid which late i promised
yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
that your estate requires and mine can yield


warwick

henry now lives in scotland at his ease
where having nothing nothing can he lose
and as for you yourself our quondam queen
you have a father able to maintain you
and better twere you troubled him than france


queen margaret

peace impudent and shameless warwick peace
proud setter up and puller down of kings
i will not hence till with my talk and tears
both full of truth i make king lewis behold
thy sly conveyance and thy lord false love
for both of you are birds of selfsame feather
post blows a horn within


king lewis xi

warwick this is some post to us or thee
enter a post


post

to warwick  my lord ambassador these letters are for you
sent from your brother marquess montague
to king lewis xi
these from our king unto your majesty
to queen margaret
and madam these for you from whom i know not
they all read their letters


oxford

i like it well that our fair queen and mistress
smiles at her news while warwick frowns at his


prince edward

nay mark how lewis stamps as he were nettled
i hope all for the best


king lewis xi

warwick what are thy news and yours fair queen


queen margaret

mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys


warwick

mine full of sorrow and heart discontent


king lewis xi

what has your king married the lady grey
and now to soothe your forgery and his
sends me a paper to persuade me patience
is this the alliance that he seeks with france
dare he presume to scorn us in this manner


queen margaret

i told your majesty as much before
this proveth edward love and warwick honesty


warwick

king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven
and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss
that i am clear from this misdeed of edward
no more my king for he dishonours me
but most himself if he could see his shame
did i forget that by the house of york
my father came untimely to his death
did i let pass the abuse done to my niece
did i impale him with the regal crown
did i put henry from his native right
and am i guerdon at the last with shame
shame on himself for my desert is honour
and to repair my honour lost for him
i here renounce him and return to henry
my noble queen let former grudges pass
and henceforth i am thy true servitor
i will revenge his wrong to lady bona
and replant henry in his former state


queen margaret

warwick these words have turn my hate to love
and i forgive and quite forget old faults
and joy that thou becomest king henry friend


warwick

so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend
that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
with some few bands of chosen soldiers
ill undertake to land them on our coast
and force the tyrant from his seat by war
tis not his new-made bride shall succor him
and as for clarence as my letters tell me
he very likely now to fall from him
for matching more for wanton lust than honour
or than for strength and safety of our country


bona

dear brother how shall bona be revenged
but by thy help to this distressed queen


queen margaret

renowned prince how shall poor henry live
unless thou rescue him from foul despair


bona

my quarrel and this english queen are one


warwick

and mine fair lady bona joins with yours


king lewis xi

and mine with hers and thine and margaret
therefore at last i firmly am resolved
you shall have aid


queen margaret

let me give humble thanks for all at once


king lewis xi

then england messenger return in post
and tell false edward thy supposed king
that lewis of france is sending over masquers
to revel it with him and his new bride
thou seest what past go fear thy king withal


bona

tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly
ill wear the willow garland for his sake


queen margaret

tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside
and i am ready to put armour on


warwick

tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
and therefore ill uncrown him eret be long
there thy reward be gone
exit post


king lewis xi

but warwick
thou and oxford with five thousand men
shall cross the seas and bid false edward battle
and as occasion serves this noble queen
and prince shall follow with a fresh supply
yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt
what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty


warwick

this shall assure my constant loyalty
that if our queen and this young prince agree
ill join mine eldest daughter and my joy
to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands


queen margaret

yes i agree and thank you for your motion
son edward she is fair and virtuous
therefore delay not give thy hand to warwick
and with thy hand thy faith irrevocable
that only warwick daughter shall be thine


prince edward

yes i accept her for she well deserves it
and here to pledge my vow i give my hand
he gives his hand to warwick


king lewis xi

why stay we now these soldiers shall be levied
and thou lord bourbon our high admiral
shalt waft them over with our royal fleet
i long till edward fall by war mischance
for mocking marriage with a dame of france
exeunt all but warwick


warwick

i came from edward as ambassador
but i return his sworn and mortal foe
matter of marriage was the charge he gave me
but dreadful war shall answer his demand
had he none else to make a stale but me
then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow
i was the chief that raised him to the crown
and ill be chief to bring him down again
not that i pity henry misery
but seek revenge on edward mockery

act iv
scene i london the palace

enter gloucester clarence somerset and montague


gloucester

now tell me brother clarence what think you
of this new marriage with the lady grey
hath not our brother made a worthy choice


clarence

alas you know tis far from hence to france
how could he stay till warwick made return


somerset

my lords forbear this talk here comes the king


gloucester

and his well-chosen bride


clarence

i mind to tell him plainly what i think
flourish enter king edward iv attended queen elizabeth pembroke stafford hastings and others


king edward iv

now brother of clarence how like you our choice
that you stand pensive as half malcontent


clarence

as well as lewis of france or the earl of warwick
which are so weak of courage and in judgment
that theyll take no offence at our abuse


king edward iv

suppose they take offence without a cause
they are but lewis and warwick i am edward
your king and warwick and must have my will


gloucester

and shall have your will because our king
yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well


king edward iv

yea brother richard are you offended too


gloucester

not i
no god forbid that i should wish them sever
whom god hath join together ay and twere pity
to sunder them that yoke so well together


king edward iv

setting your scorns and your mislike aside
tell me some reason why the lady grey
should not become my wife and england queen
and you too somerset and montague
speak freely what you think


clarence

then this is mine opinion that king lewis
becomes your enemy for mocking him
about the marriage of the lady bona


gloucester

and warwick doing what you gave in charge
is now dishonoured by this new marriage


king edward iv

what if both lewis and warwick be appeased
by such invention as i can devise


montague

yet to have join with france in such alliance
would more have strengthen this our commonwealth
gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage


hastings

why knows not montague that of itself
england is safe if true within itself


montague

but the safer when tis back with france


hastings

tis better using france than trusting france
let us be back with god and with the seas
which he hath given for fence impregnable
and with their helps only defend ourselves
in them and in ourselves our safety lies


clarence

for this one speech lord hastings well deserves
to have the heir of the lord hungerford


king edward iv

ay what of that it was my will and grant
and for this once my will shall stand for law


gloucester

and yet methinks your grace hath not done well
to give the heir and daughter of lord scales
unto the brother of your loving bride
she better would have fitted me or clarence
but in your bride you bury brotherhood


clarence

or else you would not have bestow the heir
of the lord bonville on your new wife son
and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere


king edward iv

alas poor clarence is it for a wife
that thou art malcontent i will provide thee


clarence

in choosing for yourself you show your judgment
which being shallow you give me leave
to play the broker in mine own behalf
and to that end i shortly mind to leave you


king edward iv

leave me or tarry edward will be king
and not be tied unto his brother will


queen elizabeth

my lords before it pleased his majesty
to raise my state to title of a queen
do me but right and you must all confess
that i was not ignoble of descent
and meaner than myself have had like fortune
but as this title honours me and mine
so your dislike to whom i would be pleasing
doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow


king edward iv

my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns
what danger or what sorrow can befall thee
so long as edward is thy constant friend
and their true sovereign whom they must obey
nay whom they shall obey and love thee too
unless they seek for hatred at my hands
which if they do yet will i keep thee safe
and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath


gloucester

aside  i hear yet say not much but think the more
enter a post


king edward iv

now messenger what letters or what news

post

my sovereign liege no letters and few words
but such as i without your special pardon
dare not relate


king edward iv

tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them
what answer makes king lewis unto our letters


post

at my depart these were his very words
go tell false edward thy supposed king
that lewis of france is sending over masquers
to revel it with him and his new bride


king edward iv

is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry
but what said lady bona to my marriage


post

these were her words utter with mad disdain
tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly
ill wear the willow garland for his sake


king edward iv

i blame not her she could say little less
she had the wrong but what said henry queen
for i have heard that she was there in place


post

tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done
and i am ready to put armour on


king edward iv

belike she minds to play the amazon
but what said warwick to these injuries


post

he more incensed against your majesty
than all the rest discharged me with these words
tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
and therefore ill uncrown him eret be long


king edward iv

ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words
well i will arm me being thus forewarn
they shall have wars and pay for their presumption
but say is warwick friends with margaret


post

ay gracious sovereign they are so link in
friendship
that young prince edward marries warwick daughter


clarence

belike the elder clarence will have the younger
now brother king farewell and sit you fast
for i will hence to warwick other daughter
that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage
i may not prove inferior to yourself
you that love me and warwick follow me
exit clarence and somerset follows


gloucester

aside  not i
my thoughts aim at a further matter i
stay not for the love of edward but the crown


king edward iv

clarence and somerset both gone to warwick
yet am i arm against the worst can happen
and haste is needful in this desperate case
pembroke and stafford you in our behalf
go levy men and make prepare for war
they are already or quickly will be landed
myself in person will straight follow you
exeunt pembroke and stafford
but ere i go hastings and montague
resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest
are near to warwick by blood and by alliance
tell me if you love warwick more than me
if it be so then both depart to him
i rather wish you foes than hollow friends
but if you mind to hold your true obedience
give me assurance with some friendly vow
that i may never have you in suspect


montague

so god help montague as he proves true


hastings

and hastings as he favours edward cause


king edward iv

now brother richard will you stand by us


gloucester

ay in despite of all that shall withstand you


king edward iv

why so then am i sure of victory
now therefore let us hence and lose no hour

to rest mistrustful where a noble heart
hath pawn an open hand in sign of love
else might i think that clarence edward brother
were but a feigned friend to our proceedings
but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine
and now what rests but in night coverture
thy brother being carelessly encamp
his soldiers lurking in the towns about
and but attended by a simple guard
we may surprise and take him at our pleasure
our scouts have found the adventure very easy
that as ulysses and stout diomede
with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus tents
and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds
so we well cover with the night black mantle
at unawares may beat down edward guard
and seize himself i say not slaughter him
for i intend but only to surprise him
you that will follow me to this attempt
applaud the name of henry with your leader
they all cry henry
why then let on our way in silent sort

king edward fruit true heir to the english crown


rivers

enter gloucester hastings and stanley


gloucester

now my lord hastings and sir william stanley
leave off to wonder why i drew you hither
into this chiefest thicket of the park
thus stands the case you know our king my brother
is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands
he hath good usage and great liberty
and often but attended with weak guard
comes hunting this way to disport himself
i have advertised him by secret means
that if about this hour he make his way
under the colour of his usual game
he shall here find his friends with horse and men
to set him free from his captivity
enter king edward iv and a huntsman with him


huntsman

this way my lord for this way lies the game


king edward iv

nay this way man see where the huntsmen stand
now brother of gloucester lord hastings and the rest
stand you thus close to steal the bishop deer


gloucester

brother the time and case requireth haste
your horse stands ready at the park-corner


king edward iv

but whither shall we then


hastings

to lynn my lord
and ship from thence to flanders


gloucester

well guess believe me for that was my meaning


king edward iv

stanley i will requite thy forwardness


gloucester

but wherefore stay we tis no time to talk


king edward iv

huntsman what say thou wilt thou go along


huntsman

better do so than tarry and be hang


gloucester

come then away let ha no more ado


king edward iv

bishop farewell shield thee from warwick frown
and pray that i may repossess the crown
exeunt

scene vi london the tower

flourish enter king henry vi clarence warwick  somerset henry of richmond oxford montague and lieutenant of the tower


king henry vi

master lieutenant now that god and friends
have shaken edward from the regal seat
and turn my captive state to liberty
my fear to hope my sorrows unto joys
at our enlargement what are thy due fees


lieutenant

subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns
but if an humble prayer may prevail
i then crave pardon of your majesty


king henry vi

for what lieutenant for well using me
nay be thou sure ill well requite thy kindness
for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure
ay such a pleasure as incaged birds
conceive when after many moody thoughts
at last by notes of household harmony
they quite forget their loss of liberty
but warwick after god thou set me free
and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee
he was the author thou the instrument
therefore that i may conquer fortune spite
by living low where fortune cannot hurt me
and that the people of this blessed land
may not be punish with my thwarting stars
warwick although my head still wear the crown
i here resign my government to thee
for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds


warwick

your grace hath still been famed for virtuous
and now may seem as wise as virtuous
by spying and avoiding fortune malice
for few men rightly temper with the stars
yet in this one thing let me blame your grace
for choosing me when clarence is in place


clarence

no warwick thou art worthy of the sway
to whom the heavens in thy nativity
adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown
as likely to be blest in peace and war
and therefore i yield thee my free consent


warwick

and i choose clarence only for protector


king henry vi

warwick and clarence give me both your hands
now join your hands and with your hands your hearts
that no dissension hinder government
i make you both protectors of this land
while i myself will lead a private life
and in devotion spend my latter days
to sin rebuke and my creator praise


warwick

what answers clarence to his sovereign will


clarence

that he consents if warwick yield consent
for on thy fortune i repose myself


warwick

why then though loath yet must i be content
well yoke together like a double shadow
to henry body and supply his place
i mean in bearing weight of government
while he enjoys the honour and his ease
and clarence now then it is more than needful
forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor
and all his lands and goods be confiscate


clarence

what else and that succession be determined


warwick

ay therein clarence shall not want his part


king henry vi

but with the first of all your chief affairs
let me entreat for i command no more
that margaret your queen and my son edward
be sent for to return from france with speed
for till i see them here by doubtful fear
my joy of liberty is half eclipsed


clarence

it shall be done my sovereign with all speed


king henry vi

my lord of somerset what youth is that
of whom you seem to have so tender care


somerset

my liege it is young henry earl of richmond


king henry vi

come hither england hope
lays his hand on his head
if secret powers
suggest but truth to my divining thoughts
this pretty lad will prove our country bliss
his looks are full of peaceful majesty
his head by nature framed to wear a crown
his hand to wield a sceptre and himself
likely in time to bless a regal throne
make much of him my lords for this is he
must help you more than you are hurt by me
enter a post


warwick

what news my friend


post

that edward is escaped from your brother
and fled as he hears since to burgundy


warwick

unsavoury news but how made he escape


post

he was convey by richard duke of gloucester
and the lord hastings who attended him
in secret ambush on the forest side
and from the bishop huntsmen rescued him
for hunting was his daily exercise


warwick

my brother was too careless of his charge
but let us hence my sovereign to provide
a salve for any sore that may betide
exeunt all but somerset henry of richmond and oxford


somerset

my lord i like not of this flight of edward
for doubtless burgundy will yield him help
and we shall have more wars before t be long
as henry late presaging prophecy
did glad my heart with hope of this young richmond
so doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts
what may befall him to his harm and ours
therefore lord oxford to prevent the worst
forthwith well send him hence to brittany
till storms be past of civil enmity


oxford

ay for if edward repossess the crown
tis like that richmond with the rest shall down


somerset

it shall be so he shall to brittany
come therefore let about it speedily

my waned state for henry regal crown
well have we pass and now repass the seas
and brought desired help from burgundy
what then remains we being thus arrived
from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york
but that we enter as into our dukedom


gloucester

the gates made fast brother i like not this
for many men that stumble at the threshold
are well foretold that danger lurks within


king edward iv

tush man abodements must not now affright us
by fair or foul means we must enter in
for hither will our friends repair to us


hastings

my liege ill knock once more to summon them
enter on the walls the mayor of york and his brethren


mayor

my lords we were forewarned of your coming
and shut the gates for safety of ourselves
for now we owe allegiance unto henry


king edward iv

but master mayor if henry be your king
yet edward at the least is duke of york


mayor

true my good lord i know you for no less


king edward iv

why and i challenge nothing but my dukedom
as being well content with that alone


gloucester

aside  but when the fox hath once got in his nose
hell soon find means to make the body follow


hastings

why master mayor why stand you in a doubt
open the gates we are king henry friends


mayor

ay say you so the gates shall then be open
they descend


gloucester

so twere not long of him but being enter
i doubt not i but we shall soon persuade
both him and all his brothers unto reason
enter the mayor and two aldermen below


king edward iv

so master mayor these gates must not be shut
but in the night or in the time of war

takes his keys
for edward will defend the town and thee
and all those friends that deign to follow me
march enter montgomery with drum and soldiers


gloucester

our trusty friend unless i be deceived


king edward iv

welcome sir john but why come you in arms


montague

to help king edward in his time of storm
as every loyal subject ought to do


king edward iv

thanks good montgomery but we now forget
our title to the crown and only claim
our dukedom till god please to send the rest


montague

then fare you well for i will hence again
i came to serve a king and not a duke
drummer strike up and let us march away
the drum begins to march


king edward iv

nay stay sir john awhi le and well debate
by what safe means the crown may be recover


montague

what talk you of debating in few words
if youll not here proclaim yourself our king
ill leave you to your fortune and be gone
to keep them back that come to succor you
why shall we fight if you pretend no title


gloucester

why brother wherefore stand you on nice points


king edward iv

when we grow stronger then well make our claim
till then tis wisdom to conceal our meaning


hastings

away with scrupulous wit now arms must rule


gloucester

and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns
brother we will proclaim you out of hand
the bruit thereof will bring you many friends


king edward iv

then be it as you will for tis my right

thanks brave montgomery and thanks unto you all
if fortune serve me ill requite this kindness
now for this night let harbour here in york
and when the morning sun shall raise his car
above the border of this horizon
well forward towards warwick and his mates
for well i wot that henry is no soldier
ah froward clarence how evil it beseems thee
to flatter henry and forsake thy brother
yet as we may well meet both thee and warwick
come on brave soldiers doubt not of the day
and that once gotten doubt not of large pay

with hasty germans and blunt hollanders
hath pass in safety through the narrow seas
and with his troops doth march amain to london
and many giddy people flock to him


king henry vi

let levy men and beat him back again


clarence

a little fire is quickly trodden out
which being suffer rivers cannot quench


warwick

in warwickshire i have true-hearted friends
not mutinous in peace yet bold in war
those will i muster up and thou son clarence
shalt stir up in suffolk norfolk and in kent
the knights and gentlemen to come with thee
thou brother montague in buckingham
northampton and in leicestershire shalt find
men well inclined to hear what thou command
and thou brave oxford wondrous well beloved
in oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends
my sovereign with the loving citizens
like to his island girt in with the ocean
or modest dian circled with her nymphs
shall rest in london till we come to him
fair lords take leave and stand not to reply
farewell my sovereign

exeunt all but king henry vi and exeter


king henry vi

here at the palace i will rest awhile
cousin of exeter what thinks your lordship
methinks the power that edward hath in field
should not be able to encounter mine


exeter

the doubt is that he will seduce the rest


king henry vi

that not my fear my meed hath got me fame
i have not stopp mine ears to their demands
nor posted off their suits with slow delays
my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds
my mildness hath allay their swelling griefs
my mercy dried their water-flowing tears
i have not been desirous of their wealth
nor much oppress them with great subsidies
nor forward of revenge though they much err
then why should they love edward more than me
no exeter these graces challenge grace
and when the lion fawns upon the lamb
the lamb will never cease to follow him
shout within a lancaster a lancaster


exeter

hark hark my lord what shouts are these
enter king edward iv gloucester and soldiers

warwick

confess who set thee up and pluck thee own
call warwick patron and be penitent
and thou shalt still remain the duke of york


gloucester

or did he make the jest against his will


warwick

and ten to one youll meet him in the tower


edward

gloucester

come warwick take the time kneel down kneel down
nay when strike now or else the iron cools


warwick

with whom an upright zeal to right prevails
more than the nature of a brother love
come clarence come thou wilt if warwick call


clarence

father of warwick know you what this means
taking his red rose out of his hat
look here i throw my infamy at thee
i will not ruinate my father house
who gave his blood to lime the stones together
and set up lancaster why trow thou warwick
that clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural
to bend the fatal instruments of war
against his brother and his lawful king
perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath
to keep that oath were more impiety
than jephthah when he sacrificed his daughter
i am so sorry for my trespass made
that to deserve well at my brother hands
i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe
with resolution wheresoeer i meet thee 
as i will meet thee if thou stir abroad 
to plague thee for thy foul misleading me
and so proud-hearted warwick i defy thee
and to my brother turn my blushing cheeks
pardon me edward i will make amends
and richard do not frown upon my faults
for i will henceforth be no more unconstant


king edward iv

now welcome more and ten times more beloved
than if thou never hadst deserved our hate


gloucester

welcome good clarence this is brotherlike

exit


warwick

ah who is nigh come to me friend or foe
and tell me who is victor york or warwick
why ask i that my mangled body shows
my blood my want of strength my sick heart shows
that i must yield my body to the earth
and by my fall the conquest to my foe
thus yields the cedar to the axe edge
whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle
under whose shade the ramping lion slept
whose top-branch overpeer jove spreading tree
and kept low shrubs from winter powerful wind
these eyes that now are dimm with death black veil
have been as piercing as the mid-day sun
to search the secret treasons of the world
the wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood
were liken oft to kingly sepulchres
for who lived king but i could dig his grave
and who durst mine when warwick bent his brow
lo now my glory smear in dust and blood
my parks my walks my manors that i had
even now forsake me and of all my lands
is nothing left me but my body length
why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust
and live we how we can yet die we must
enter oxford and somerset


somerset

ah warwick warwick wert thou as we are
we might recover all our loss again
the queen from france hath brought a puissant power
even now we heard the news ah could thou fly


warwick

why then i would not fly ah montague
if thou be there sweet brother take my hand
and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile
thou lovest me not for brother if thou didst
thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
that glues my lips and will not let me speak
come quickly montague or i am dead


somerset

ah warwick montague hath breathed his last
and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick
and said commend me to my valiant brother
and more he would have said and more he spoke
which sounded like a clamour in a vault
that mought not be distinguished but at last
i well might hear delivered with a groan
o farewell warwick

sweet rest his soul fly lords and save yourselves
for warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven

ere he attain his easeful western bed
i mean my lords those powers that the queen
hath raised in gallia have arrived our coast

a little gale will soon disperse that cloud

the cable broke the holding-anchor lost
and half our sailors swallow in the flood
yet lives our pilot still ist meet that he
should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
with tearful eyes add water to the sea
and give more strength to that which hath too much
whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock
which industry and courage might have saved
ah what a shame ah what a fault were this
say warwick was our anchor what of that

our slaughter friends the tackles what of these
why is not oxford here another anchor
and somerset another goodly mast
the friends of france our shrouds and tacklings
and though unskilful why not ned and i
for once allow the skilful pilot charge
we will not from the helm to sit and weep
but keep our course though the rough wind say no
from shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck
as good to chide the waves as speak them fair
and what is edward but ruthless sea
what clarence but a quicksand of deceit
and richard but a ragged fatal rock
all these the enemies to our poor bark
say you can swim alas tis but a while
tread on the sand why there you quickly sink
bestride the rock the tide will wash you off
or else you famish that a threefold death
this speak i lords to let you understand
if case some one of you would fly from us
that there no hoped-for mercy with the brothers
more than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks
why courage then what cannot be avoided
twere childish weakness to lament or fear


prince edward

methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
should if a coward heard her speak these words
infuse his breast with magnanimity
and make him naked foil a man at arms
i speak not this as doubting any here
for did i but suspect a fearful man
he should have leave to go away betimes
lest in our need he might infect another
and make him of like spirit to himself
if any such be here as god forbid 
let him depart before we need his help

women and children of so high a courage
and warriors faint why twere perpetual shame
o brave young prince thy famous grandfather

scene vi london the tower

enter king henry vi and gloucester with the lieutenant on the walls


gloucester

good day my lord what at your book so hard


king henry vi

ay my good lord my lord i should say rather
tis sin to flatter good was little better
good gloucester and good devil were alike
and both preposterous therefore not good lord


gloucester

sirrah leave us to ourselves we must confer
exit lieutenant


king henry vi

so flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf
so first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
and next his throat unto the butcher knife
what scene of death hath roscius now to act


gloucester

suspicion always haunts the guilty mind
the thief doth fear each bush an officer


king henry vi

the bird that hath been limed in a bush
with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush
and i the hapless male to one sweet bird
have now the fatal object in my eye
where my poor young was limed was caught and kill


gloucester

why what a peevish fool was that of crete
that taught his son the office of a fowl
an yet for all his wings the fool was drown


king henry vi

i daedalus my poor boy icarus
thy father minos that denied our course
the sun that sear the wings of my sweet boy
thy brother edward and thyself the sea
whose envious gulf did swallow up his life
ah kill me with thy weapon not with words
my breast can better brook thy dagger point
than can my ears that tragic history
but wherefore dost thou come ist for my life


gloucester

think thou i am an executioner


king henry vi

a persecutor i am sure thou art
if murdering innocents be executing
why then thou art an executioner


gloucester

thy son i kill for his presumption


king henry vi

hadst thou been kill when first thou didst presume
thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine
and thus i prophesy that many a thousand
which now mistrust no parcel of my fear
and many an old man sigh and many a widow
and many an orphan water-standing eye 
men for their sons wives for their husbands
and orphans for their parents timeless death 
shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born
the owl shriek at thy birth an evil sign
the night-crow cried aboding luckless time
dogs howl and hideous tempest shook down trees
the raven rook her on the chimney top
and chattering pies in dismal discords sung
thy mother felt more than a mother pain
and yet brought forth less than a mother hope
to wit an indigested and deformed lump
not like the fruit of such a goodly tree
teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born
to signify thou camest to bite the world
and if the rest be true which i have heard
thou camest 


gloucester

ill hear no more die prophet in thy speech
stabs him
for this amongst the rest was i ordain


king henry vi

ay and for much more slaughter after this
god forgive my sins and pardon thee
dies


gloucester

what will the aspiring blood of lancaster
sink in the ground i thought it would have mounted
see how my sword weeps for the poor king death
o may such purple tears be alway shed
from those that wish the downfall of our house
if any spark of life be yet remaining
down down to hell and say i sent thee thither
stabs him again
i that have neither pity love nor fear
indeed tis true that henry told me of
for i have often heard my mother say
i came into the world with my legs forward
had i not reason think ye to make haste
and seek their ruin that usurp our right
the midwife wonder and the women cried
o jesus bless us he is born with teeth
and so i was which plainly signified
that i should snarl and bite and play the dog
then since the heavens have shaped my body so
let hell make crook my mind to answer it
i have no brother i am like no brother
and this word love which graybeards call divine
be resident in men like one another
and not in me i am myself alone
clarence beware thou keep me from the light
but i will sort a pitchy day for thee
for i will buz abroad such prophecies
that edward shall be fearful of his life
and then to purge his fear ill be thy death
king henry and the prince his son are gone
clarence thy turn is next and then the rest
counting myself but bad till i be best
ill throw thy body in another room
and triumph henry in thy day of doom
exit with the body

scene i rousillon the count palace

enter bertram the countess of rousillon helena and lafeu all in black


countess

in delivering my son from me i bury a second husband


bertram

and i in going madam weep oer my father death
anew but i must attend his majesty command to
whom i am now in ward evermore in subjection


lafeu

you shall find of the king a husband madam you
sir a father he that so generally is at all times
good must of necessity hold his virtue to you whose
worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
than lack it where there is such abundance


countess

what hope is there of his majesty amendment


lafeu

he hath abandoned his physicians madam under whose
practises he hath persecuted time with hope and
finds no other advantage in the process but only the
losing of hope by time


countess

this young gentlewoman had a father o that
had how sad a passage tis whose skill was
almost as great as his honesty had it stretched so
far would have made nature immortal and death
should have play for lack of work would for the
king sake he were living i think it would be
the death of the king disease


lafeu

how called you the man you speak of madam


countess

he was famous sir in his profession and it was
his great right to be so gerard de narbon


lafeu

he was excellent indeed madam the king very
lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly he
was skilful enough to have lived still if knowledge
could be set up against mortality


bertram

what is it my good lord the king languishes of


lafeu

a fistula my lord


bertram

i heard not of it before


lafeu

i would it were not notorious was this gentlewoman
the daughter of gerard de narbon


countess

his sole child my lord and bequeathed to my
overlooking i have those hopes of her good that
her education promises her dispositions she
inherits which makes fair gifts fairer for where
an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities there
commendations go with pity they are virtues and
traitors too in her they are the better for their
simpleness she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness


lafeu

your commendations madam get from her tears


countess

tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
in the remembrance of her father never approaches
her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
livelihood from her cheek no more of this helena
go to no more lest it be rather thought you affect
a sorrow than have it


helena

i do affect a sorrow indeed but i have it too


lafeu

moderate lamentation is the right of the dead
excessive grief the enemy to the living


countess

if the living be enemy to the grief the excess
makes it soon mortal


bertram

madam i desire your holy wishes


lafeu

how understand we that


countess

be thou blest bertram and succeed thy father
in manners as in shape thy blood and virtue
contend for empire in thee and thy goodness
share with thy birthright love all trust a few
do wrong to none be able for thine enemy
rather in power than use and keep thy friend
under thy own life key be cheque for silence
but never tax for speech what heaven more will
that thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down
fall on thy head farewell my lord
tis an unseason courtier good my lord
advise him


lafeu

he cannot want the best
that shall attend his love


countess

heaven bless him farewell bertram

bertram

to helena  the best wishes that can be forged in
your thoughts be servants to you be comfortable
to my mother your mistress and make much of her


lafeu

farewell pretty lady you must hold the credit of
your father
exeunt bertram and lafeu


helena

o were that all i think not on my father
and these great tears grace his remembrance more
than those i shed for him what was he like
i have forgot him my imagination
carries no favour int but bertram
i am undone there is no living none
if bertram be away twere all one
that i should love a bright particular star
and think to wed it he is so above me
in his bright radiance and collateral light
must i be comforted not in his sphere
the ambition in my love thus plagues itself
the hind that would be mated by the lion
must die for love twas pretty though plague
to see him every hour to sit and draw
his arched brows his hawking eye his curls
in our heart table heart too capable
of every line and trick of his sweet favour
but now he gone and my idolatrous fancy
must sanctify his reliques who comes here
enter parolles
aside
one that goes with him i love him for his sake
and yet i know him a notorious liar
think him a great way fool solely a coward
yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him
that they take place when virtue steely bones
look bleak i the cold wind withal full oft we see
cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly


parolles

save you fair queen


helena

and you monarch


parolles

no


helena

and no


parolles

are you meditating on virginity


helena

ay you have some stain of soldier in you let me
ask you a question man is enemy to virginity how
may we barricado it against him


parolles

keep him out


helena

but he assails and our virginity though valiant
in the defence yet is weak unfold to us some
warlike resistance


parolles

there is none man sitting down before you will
undermine you and blow you up


helena

bless our poor virginity from underminers and
blowers up is there no military policy how
virgins might blow up men


parolles

virginity being blown down man will quicklier be
blown up marry in blowing him down again with
the breach yourselves made you lose your city it
is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
preserve virginity loss of virginity is rational
increase and there was never virgin got till
virginity was first lost that you were made of is
metal to make virgins virginity by being once lost
may be ten times found by being ever kept it is
ever lost tis too cold a companion away with t


helena

i will stand for t a little though therefore i die a virgin


parolles

there little can be said in t tis against the
rule of nature to speak on the part of virginity
is to accuse your mothers which is most infallible
disobedience he that hangs himself is a virgin
virginity murders itself and should be buried in
highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate
offendress against nature virginity breeds mites
much like a cheese consumes itself to the very
paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach
besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of
self-love which is the most inhibited sin in the
canon keep it not you cannot choose but loose
byt out with t within ten year it will make
itself ten which is a goodly increase and the
principal itself not much the worse away with t


helena

how might one do sir to lose it to her own liking


parolles

let me see marry ill to like him that neer it
likes tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
lying the longer kept the less worth off with t
while tis vendible answer the time of request
virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out
of fashion richly suited but unsuitable just
like the brooch and the tooth-pick which wear not
now your date is better in your pie and your
porridge than in your cheek and your virginity
your old virginity is like one of our french
withered pears it looks ill it eats drily marry
tis a withered pear it was formerly better
marry yet tis a withered pear will you anything with it


helena

not my virginity yet          
there shall your master have a thousand loves
a mother and a mistress and a friend
a phoenix captain and an enemy
a guide a goddess and a sovereign
a counsellor a traitress and a dear
his humble ambition proud humility
his jarring concord and his discord dulcet
his faith his sweet disaster with a world
of pretty fond adoptious christendoms
that blinking cupid gossips now shall he 
i know not what he shall god send him well
the court a learning place and he is one 


parolles

what one i faith


helena

that i wish well tis pity 


parolles

what pity


helena

that wishing well had not a body int
which might be felt that we the poorer born
whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes
might with effects of them follow our friends
and show what we alone must think which never
return us thanks

helena

the wars have so kept you under that you must needs

parolles

helena

when he was retrograde i think rather


parolles

why think you so


helena

you go so much backward when you fight


parolles

that for advantage


helena

so is running away when fear proposes the safety
but the composition that your valour and fear makes
in you is a virtue of a good wing and i like the wear well


parolles

i am so full of businesses i cannot answer thee
acutely i will return perfect courtier in the
which my instruction shall serve to naturalize
thee so thou wilt be capable of a courtier
counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
thee else thou diest in thine unthankfulness and
thine ignorance makes thee away farewell when
thou hast leisure say thy prayers when thou hast
none remember thy friends get thee a good husband
and use him as he uses thee so farewell

helena

our remedies oft in ourselves do lie
which we ascribe to heaven the fated sky
gives us free scope only doth backward pull
our slow designs when we ourselves are dull
what power is it which mounts my love so high
that makes me see and cannot feed mine eye
the mightiest space in fortune nature brings
to join like likes and kiss like native things
impossible be strange attempts to those
that weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
what hath been cannot be who ever strove
so show her merit that did miss her love
the king disease my project may deceive me
but my intents are fix and will not leave me

the florentines and senoys are by the ears
have fought with equal fortune and continue
a braving war


first lord

so tis reported sir


king

nay tis most credible we here received it
a certainty vouch from our cousin austria
with caution that the florentine will move us
for speedy aid wherein our dearest friend
prejudicates the business and would seem
to have us make denial


first lord

his love and wisdom
approved so to your majesty may plead
for amplest credence


king

he hath arm our answer
and florence is denied before he comes
yet for our gentlemen that mean to see
the tuscan service freely have they leave
to stand on either part


second lord

it well may serve
a nursery to our gentry who are sick
for breathing and exploit


king

what he comes here
enter bertram lafeu and parolles


first lord

it is the count rousillon my good lord
young bertram


king

youth thou bear thy father face
frank nature rather curious than in haste
hath well composed thee thy father moral parts
mayst thou inherit too welcome to paris


bertram

my thanks and duty are your majesty


king

i would i had that corporal soundness now
as when thy father and myself in friendship
first tried our soldiership he did look far
into the service of the time and was
discipled of the bravest he lasted long
but on us both did haggish age steal on
and wore us out of act it much repairs me
to talk of your good father in his youth
he had the wit which i can well observe
to-day in our young lords but they may jest
till their own scorn return to them unnoted
ere they can hide their levity in honour
so like a courtier contempt nor bitterness
were in his pride or sharpness if they were
his equal had awaked them and his honour
clock to itself knew the true minute when
exception bid him speak and at this time
his tongue obey his hand who were below him
he used as creatures of another place
and bow his eminent top to their low ranks
making them proud of his humility
in their poor praise he humbled such a man
might be a copy to these younger times
which follow well would demonstrate them now
but goers backward


bertram

his good remembrance sir
lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb
so in approof lives not his epitaph
as in your royal speech


king

would i were with him he would always say 
methinks i hear him now his plausive words
he scatter not in ears but grafted them
to grow there and to bear let me not live 
this his good melancholy oft began
on the catastrophe and heel of pastime
when it was out let me not live quoth he
after my flame lacks oil to be the snuff
of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses
all but new things disdain whose judgments are
mere fathers of their garments whose constancies
expire before their fashions this he wish
i after him do after him wish too
since i nor wax nor honey can bring home
i quickly were dissolved from my hive
to give some labourers room


second lord

you are loved sir
they that least lend it you shall lack you first


king

i fill a place i knowt how long ist count
since the physician at your father died
he was much famed


bertram

some six months since my lord

such difference betwixt their two estates love no
god that would not extend his might only where

that before you and next unto high heaven
i love your son
my friends were poor but honest so my love
be not offended for it hurts not him
that he is loved of me i follow him not
by any token of presumptuous suit
nor would i have him till i do deserve him
yet never know how that desert should be
i know i love in vain strive against hope
yet in this captious and intenible sieve
i still pour in the waters of my love
and lack not to lose still thus indian-like
religious in mine error i adore
the sun that looks upon his worshipper
but knows of him no more my dearest madam
let not your hate encounter with my love
for loving where you do but if yourself
whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth
did ever in so true a flame of liking
wish chastely and love dearly that your dian
was both herself and love o then give pity
to her whose state is such that cannot choose
but lend and give where she is sure to lose
that seeks not to find that her search implies
but riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies


countess

had you not lately an intent speak truly 
to go to paris


helena

madam i had


countess

wherefore tell true


helena

i will tell truth by grace itself i swear
you know my father left me some prescriptions
of rare and proved effects such as his reading
and manifest experience had collected
for general sovereignty and that he will me
in heedfull reservation to bestow them
as notes whose faculties inclusive were
more than they were in note amongst the rest
there is a remedy approved set down
to cure the desperate languishings whereof
the king is render lost


countess

this was your motive
for paris was it speak


helena

my lord your son made me to think of this
else paris and the medicine and the king
had from the conversation of my thoughts
haply been absent then


countess

but think you helen
if you should tender your supposed aid
he would receive it he and his physicians
are of a mind he that they cannot help him
they that they cannot help how shall they credit
a poor unlearned virgin when the schools
embowell of their doctrine have left off
the danger to itself


helena

there something int
more than my father skill which was the greatest
of his profession that his good receipt
shall for my legacy be sanctified
by the luckiest stars in heaven and would your honour
but give me leave to try success ild venture
the well-lost life of mine on his grace cure
by such a day and hour


countess

dost thou believet


helena

parolles

noble lords you have restrained yourself within the
list of too cold an adieu be more expressive to
them for they wear themselves in the cap of the
time there do muster true gait eat speak and
move under the influence of the most received star
and though the devil lead the measure such are to
be followed after them and take a more dilated farewell

lafeu

king

lafeu

then here a man stands that has brought his pardon
i would you had kneel my lord to ask me mercy
and that at my bidding you could so stand up


king

i would i had so i had broke thy pate
and ask thee mercy fort


lafeu

good faith across but my good lord tis thus
will you be cured of your infirmity


king

no


lafeu

o will you eat no grapes my royal fox
yes but you will my noble grapes an if
my royal fox could reach them i have seen a medicine
that able to breathe life into a stone
quicken a rock and make you dance canary
with spritely fire and motion whose simple touch
is powerful to araise king pepin nay
to give great charlemain a pen in hand
and write to her a love-line


king

what her is this


lafeu

why doctor she my lord there one arrived
if you will see her now by my faith and honour
if seriously i may convey my thoughts
in this my light deliverance i have spoke
with one that in her sex her years profession
wisdom and constancy hath amazed me more
than i dare blame my weakness will you see her
for that is her demand and know her business
that done laugh well at me


king

now good lafeu
bring in the admiration that we with thee
may spend our wonder too or take off thine
by wondering how thou took it


lafeu

nay ill fit you
and not be all day neither
exit


king

thus he his special nothing ever prologues
re-enter lafeu with helena


lafeu

nay come your ways


king

this haste hath wings indeed


lafeu

nay come your ways
this is his majesty say your mind to him
a traitor you do look like but such traitors
his majesty seldom fears i am cressid uncle
that dare leave two together fare you well
exit


king

now fair one does your business follow us


helena

ay my good lord
gerard de narbon was my father
in what he did profess well found


king

i knew him


helena

the rather will i spare my praises towards him
knowing him is enough on bed of death
many receipts he gave me chiefly one
which as the dearest issue of his practise
and of his old experience the oily darling
he bade me store up as a triple eye
safer than mine own two more dear i have so
and hearing your high majesty is touch
with that malignant cause wherein the honour
of my dear father gift stands chief in power
i come to tender it and my appliance
with all bound humbleness


king

we thank you maiden
but may not be so credulous of cure
when our most learned doctors leave us and
the congregated college have concluded
that labouring art can never ransom nature
from her inaidible estate i say we must not
so stain our judgment or corrupt our hope
to prostitute our past-cure malady
to empirics or to dissever so
our great self and our credit to esteem
a senseless help when help past sense we deem


helena

my duty then shall pay me for my pains
i will no more enforce mine office on you
humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
a modest one to bear me back again


king

i cannot give thee less to be call grateful
thou thought to help me and such thanks i give
as one near death to those that wish him live
but what at full i know thou know no part
i knowing all my peril thou no art


helena

what i can do can do no hurt to try
since you set up your rest gainst remedy
he that of greatest works is finisher
oft does them by the weakest minister
so holy writ in babes hath judgment shown
when judges have been babes great floods have flown
from simple sources and great seas have dried
when miracles have by the greatest been denied
oft expectation fails and most oft there
where most it promises and oft it hits
where hope is coldest and despair most fits


king

i must not hear thee fare thee well kind maid
thy pains not used must by thyself be paid
proffers not took reap thanks for their reward


helena

inspired merit so by breath is barr
it is not so with him that all things knows
as tis with us that square our guess by shows
but most it is presumption in us when
the help of heaven we count the act of men
dear sir to my endeavours give consent
of heaven not me make an experiment
i am not an impostor that proclaim
myself against the level of mine aim
but know i think and think i know most sure
my art is not past power nor you past cure


king

are thou so confident within what space
hopest thou my cure


helena

the great grace lending grace
ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
their fiery torcher his diurnal ring
ere twice in murk and occidental damp
moist hesperus hath quench his sleepy lamp
or four and twenty times the pilot glass
hath told the thievish minutes how they pass
what is infirm from your sound parts shall fly
health shall live free and sickness freely die


king

upon thy certainty and confidence
what darest thou venture


helena

tax of impudence
a strumpet boldness a divulged shame
traduced by odious ballads my maiden name
sear otherwise nay worse if worse extended
with vilest torture let my life be ended


king

methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
his powerful sound within an organ weak
and what impossibility would slay
in common sense sense saves another way
thy life is dear for all that life can rate
worth name of life in thee hath estimate
youth beauty wisdom courage all
that happiness and prime can happy call
thou this to hazard needs must intimate
skill infinite or monstrous desperate
sweet practiser thy physic i will try
that ministers thine own death if i die


helena

if i break time or flinch in property
of what i spoke unpitied let me die
and well deserved not helping death my fee
but if i help what do you promise me


king

make thy demand


helena

but will you make it even


king

ay by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven


helena

then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
what husband in thy power i will command
exempted be from me the arrogance
to choose from forth the royal blood of france
my low and humble name to propagate
with any branch or image of thy state
but such a one thy vassal whom i know
is free for me to ask thee to bestow


king

here is my hand the premises observed
thy will by my performance shall be served
so make the choice of thy own time for i
thy resolved patient on thee still rely
more should i question thee and more i must
though more to know could not be more to trust
from whence thou camest how tended on but rest
unquestion welcome and undoubted blest
give me some help here ho if thou proceed
as high as word my deed shall match thy meed

clown

as your french crown for your taffeta punk as tib

tuesday a morris for may-day as the nail to his
hole the cuckold to his horn as a scolding queen
to a wrangling knave as the nun lip to the
friar mouth nay as the pudding to his skin


countess

questions


clown

from below your duke to beneath your constable it
will fit any question


countess

must fit all demands


clown

should speak truth of it here it is and all that
belongs tot ask me if i am a courtier it shall

scene iii paris the king palace

enter bertram lafeu and parolles


lafeu

they say miracles are past and we have our
philosophical persons to make modern and familiar
things supernatural and causeless hence is it that
we make trifles of terrors ensconcing ourselves
into seeming knowledge when we should submit
ourselves to an unknown fear


parolles

why tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath
shot out in our latter times


bertram

and so tis


lafeu

to be relinquish of the artists 


parolles

so i say


lafeu

both of galen and paracelsus


parolles

so i say


lafeu

of all the learned and authentic fellows 


parolles

right so i say


lafeu

that gave him out incurable 


parolles

why there tis so say i too


lafeu

not to be helped 


parolles

right as twere a man assured of a 


lafeu

uncertain life and sure death


parolles

just you say well so would i have said


lafeu

i may truly say it is a novelty to the world


parolles

it is indeed if you will have it in showing you
shall read it in what do you call there


lafeu

a showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor


parolles

that it i would have said the very same


lafeu

why your dolphin is not lustier fore me
i speak in respect 


parolles

nay tis strange tis very strange that is the
brief and the tedious of it and he of a most
facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the 


lafeu

very hand of heaven


parolles

ay so i say


lafeu

in a most weak 
pausing
and debile minister great power great
transcendence which should indeed give us a
further use to be made than alone the recovery of
the king as to be 
pausing
generally thankful

of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing
oer whom both sovereign power and father voice
i have to use thy frank election make
thou hast power to choose and they none to forsake


helena

fall when love please marry to each but one


lafeu

and writ as little beard


king

not one of those but had a noble father


helena

gentlemen
heaven hath through me restored the king to health


all

we understand it and thank heaven for you


helena

i am a simple maid and therein wealthiest
that i protest i simply am a maid
please it your majesty i have done already
the blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me
we blush that thou shouldst choose but be refused
let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever
well neer come there again


king

make choice and see
who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me


helena

now dian from thy altar do i fly
and to imperial love that god most high
do my sighs stream sir will you hear my suit


first lord

and grant it


helena

thanks sir all the rest is mute


lafeu

i had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace
for my life


helena

before i speak too threateningly replies
love make your fortunes twenty times above
her that so wishes and her humble love


second lord

no better if you please


helena

my wish receive
which great love grant and so i take my leave


lafeu

turk to make eunuchs of


helena

be not afraid that i your hand should take
ill never do you wrong for your own sake
blessing upon your vows and in your bed
find fairer fortune if you ever wed


lafeu

these boys are boys of ice theyll none have her
sure they are bastards to the english the french
neer got em


helena

you are too young too happy and too good
to make yourself a son out of my blood


fourth lord

fair one i think not so


lafeu

there one grape yet i am sure thy father drunk
wine but if thou be not an ass i am a youth
of fourteen i have known thee already


helena

to bertram  i dare not say i take you but i give
me and my service ever whilst i live
into your guiding power this is the man


king

why then young bertram take her she thy wife


bertram

my wife my liege i shall beseech your highness
in such a business give me leave to use
the help of mine own eyes


king

know thou not bertram
what she has done for me


bertram

yes my good lord
but never hope to know why i should marry her


king

thou know she has raised me from my sickly bed


bertram

but follows it my lord to bring me down
must answer for your raising i know her well
she had her breeding at my father charge
a poor physician daughter my wife disdain
rather corrupt me ever


king

tis only title thou disdain in her the which
i can build up strange is it that our bloods
of colour weight and heat pour all together
would quite confound distinction yet stand off
in differences so mighty if she be
all that is virtuous save what thou dislikest
a poor physician daughter thou dislikest
of virtue for the name but do not so
from lowest place when virtuous things proceed
the place is dignified by the doer deed
where great additions swell and virtue none
it is a dropsied honour good alone
is good without a name vileness is so
the property by what it is should go
not by the title she is young wise fair
in these to nature she immediate heir
and these breed honour that is honour scorn
which challenges itself as honour born
and is not like the sire honours thrive
when rather from our acts we them derive
than our foregoers the mere word a slave
debosh on every tomb on every grave
a lying trophy and as oft is dumb
where dust and damn oblivion is the tomb
of honour bones indeed what should be said
if thou canst like this creature as a maid
i can create the rest virtue and she
is her own dower honour and wealth from me


bertram

i cannot love her nor will strive to dot


king

thou wrong thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose


helena

that you are well restored my lord im glad
let the rest go


king

my honour at the stake which to defeat
i must produce my power here take her hand
proud scornful boy unworthy this good gift
that dost in vile misprision shackle up
my love and her desert that canst not dream
we poising us in her defective scale
shall weigh thee to the beam that wilt not know
it is in us to plant thine honour where
we please to have it grow cheque thy contempt
obey our will which travails in thy good
believe not thy disdain but presently
do thine own fortunes that obedient right
which both thy duty owes and our power claims
or i will throw thee from my care for ever
into the staggers and the careless lapse
of youth and ignorance both my revenge and hate
loosing upon thee in the name of justice
without all terms of pity speak thine answer


bertram

pardon my gracious lord for i submit
my fancy to your eyes when i consider
what great creation and what dole of honour
flies where you bid it i find that she which late
was in my nobler thoughts most base is now
the praised of the king who so ennobled
is as twere born so


king

take her by the hand
and tell her she is thine to whom i promise
a counterpoise if not to thy estate
a balance more replete


bertram

i take her hand


king

good fortune and the favour of the king
smile upon this contract whose ceremony
shall seem expedient on the now-born brief
and be perform to-night the solemn feast
shall more attend upon the coming space
expecting absent friends as thou lovest her
thy love to me religious else does err
exeunt all but lafeu and parolles

lafeu

i did think thee for two ordinaries to be a pretty
wise fellow thou didst make tolerable vent of thy
travel it might pass yet the scarfs and the
bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from
believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen i
have now found thee when i lose thee again i care
not yet art thou good for nothing but taking up and
that thout scarce worth


parolles

lafeu

bate thee a scruple


parolles

a smack o the contrary if ever thou be bound
in thy scarf and beaten thou shalt find what it is
to be proud of thy bondage i have a desire to hold
my acquaintance with thee or rather my knowledge
that i may say in the default he is a man i know


parolles

lafeu

honour if i were but two hours younger ild beat
thee methinks thou art a general offence and
every man should beat thee i think thou wast
created for men to breathe themselves upon thee


parolles

lafeu

go to sir you were beaten in italy for picking a
kernel out of a pomegranate you are a vagabond and
no true traveller you are more saucy with lords
and honourable personages than the commission of your
birth and virtue gives you heraldry you are not

bertram

parolles

that hugs his kicky-wicky here at home

the great prerogative and rite of love

which they distil now in the curbed time
to make the coming hour oerflow with joy
and pleasure drown the brim

second lord

bertram

do you think i am so far deceived in him


second lord

believe it my lord in mine own direct knowledge
without any malice but to speak of him as my
kinsman he a most notable coward an infinite and
endless liar an hourly promise-breaker the owner
of no one good quality worthy your lordship
entertainment


first lord

it were fit you knew him lest reposing too far in
his virtue which he hath not he might at some
great and trusty business in a main danger fail you


bertram

i would i knew in what particular action to try him


first lord

none better than to let him fetch off his drum
which you hear him so confidently undertake to do


second lord

i with a troop of florentines will suddenly
surprise him such i will have whom i am sure he
knows not from the enemy we will bind and hoodwink
him so that he shall suppose no other but that he
is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when
we bring him to our own tents be but your lordship
present at his examination if he do not for the
promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of
base fear offer to betray you and deliver all the
intelligence in his power against you and that with
the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never
trust my judgment in any thing


first lord

o for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum
he says he has a stratagem fort when your
lordship sees the bottom of his success int and to
what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be
melted if you give him not john drum
entertainment your inclining cannot be removed
here he comes
enter parolles


second lord

aside to bertram  o for the love of laughter
hinder not the honour of his design let him fetch
off his drum in any hand


bertram

how now monsieur this drum sticks sorely in your
disposition


first lord

a pox ont let it go tis but a drum


parolles

but a drum ist but a drum a drum so lost
there was excellent command to charge in with our
horse upon our own wings and to rend our own soldiers


first lord

that was not to be blamed in the command of the
service it was a disaster of war that caesar
himself could not have prevented if he had been
there to command


bertram

well we cannot greatly condemn our success some
dishonour we had in the loss of that drum but it is
not to be recovered


parolles

it might have been recovered


bertram

it might but it is not now


parolles

it is to be recovered but that the merit of
service is seldom attributed to the true and exact
performer i would have that drum or another or
hic jacet


bertram

why if you have a stomach tot monsieur if you
think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
instrument of honour again into his native quarter
be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on i will
grace the attempt for a worthy exploit if you
speed well in it the duke shall both speak of it
and extend to you what further becomes his
greatness even to the utmost syllable of your
worthiness


parolles

by the hand of a soldier i will undertake it


bertram

but you must not now slumber in it


parolles

ill about it this evening and i will presently
pen down my dilemmas encourage myself in my
certainty put myself into my mortal preparation
and by midnight look to hear further from me


bertram

may i be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it

the attempt i vow


bertram

thy soldiership will subscribe for thee farewell

second lord

strange fellow my lord that so confidently seems
to undertake this business which he knows is not to
be done damns himself to do and dares better be
damned than to dot


first lord

you do not know him my lord as we do certain it
is that he will steal himself into a man favour and
for a week escape a great deal of discoveries but
when you find him out you have him ever after


bertram

why do you think he will make no deed at all of
this that so seriously he does address himself unto


second lord

none in the world but return with an invention and
clap upon you two or three probable lies but we
have almost embossed him you shall see his fall
to-night for indeed he is not for your lordship respect


first lord

well make you some sport with the fox ere we case

the bottom of your purpose


helena

you see it lawful then it is no more

bertram

titled goddess
and worth it with addition but fair soul
in your fine frame hath love no quality
if quick fire of youth light not your mind
you are no maiden but a monument
when you are dead you should be such a one
as you are now for you are cold and stem
and now you should be as your mother was
when your sweet self was got


diana

she then was honest


bertram

so should you be


diana

no
my mother did but duty such my lord

ay so you serve us
till we serve you but when you have our roses
you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
and mock us with our bareness


bertram

how have i sworn


diana

tis not the many oaths that makes the truth
but the plain single vow that is vow true
what is not holy that we swear not by
but take the high to witness then pray you tell me
if i should swear by god great attributes
i loved you dearly would you believe my oaths
when i did love you ill this has no holding
to swear by him whom i protest to love
that i will work against him therefore your oaths
are words and poor conditions but unseal
at least in my opinion


bertram

change it change it
be not so holy-cruel love is holy
and my integrity neer knew the crafts
that you do charge men with stand no more off
but give thyself unto my sick desires
who then recover say thou art mine and ever
my love as it begins shall so persever

i see that men make ropes in such a scarre
that well forsake ourselves give me that ring


bertram

ill lend it thee my dear but have no power
to give it from me


diana

will you not my lord


bertram

it is an honour longing to our house
bequeathed down from many ancestors

exit

scene iii the florentine camp

enter the two french lords and some two or three soldiers


first lord

you have not given him his mother letter


second lord

i have delivered it an hour since there is
something int that stings his nature for on the
reading it he changed almost into another man


first lord

he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking
off so good a wife and so sweet a lady


second lord

especially he hath incurred the everlasting
displeasure of the king who had even tuned his
bounty to sing happiness to him i will tell you a
thing but you shall let it dwell darkly with you


first lord

when you have spoken it tis dead and i am the
grave of it


second lord

he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in
florence of a most chaste renown and this night he
fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour he hath
given her his monumental ring and thinks himself
made in the unchaste composition


first lord

now god delay our rebellion as we are ourselves
what things are we


second lord

merely our own traitors and as in the common course
of all treasons we still see them reveal
themselves till they attain to their abhorred ends
so he that in this action contrives against his own
nobility in his proper stream oerflows himself


first lord

is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of
our unlawful intents we shall not then have his
company to-night


second lord

not till after midnight for he is dieted to his hour


first lord

that approaches apace i would gladly have him see
his company anatomized that he might take a measure
of his own judgments wherein so curiously he had
set this counterfeit


second lord

we will not meddle with him till he come for his
presence must be the whip of the other


first lord

in the mean time what hear you of these wars


second lord

i hear there is an overture of peace


first lord

nay i assure you a peace concluded


second lord

what will count rousillon do then will he travel
higher or return again into france


first lord

i perceive by this demand you are not altogether
of his council


second lord

let it be forbid sir so should i be a great deal
of his act


first lord

sir his wife some two months since fled from his
house her pretence is a pilgrimage to saint jaques
le grand which holy undertaking with most austere
sanctimony she accomplished and there residing the
tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
grief in fine made a groan of her last breath and
now she sings in heaven


second lord

how is this justified


first lord

the stronger part of it by her own letters which
makes her story true even to the point of her
death her death itself which could not be her
office to say is come was faithfully confirmed by
the rector of the place


second lord

hath the count all this intelligence


first lord

ay and the particular confirmations point from
point so to the full arming of the verity


second lord

i am heartily sorry that hell be glad of this


first lord

how mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses


second lord

and how mightily some other times we drown our gain
in tears the great dignity that his valour hath
here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
with a shame as ample


first lord

the web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and
ill together our virtues would be proud if our
faults whipped them not and our crimes would
despair if they were not cherished by our virtues
enter a messenger
how now where your master


servant

he met the duke in the street sir of whom he hath
taken a solemn leave his lordship will next
morning for france the duke hath offered him

hear of it hereafter but shall we have this
dialogue between the fool and the soldier come
bring forth this counterfeit module he has deceived
me like a double-meaning prophesier


second lord

poor gallant knave


bertram

his spurs so long how does he carry himself


second lord

hath confessed himself to morgan whom he supposes
to be a friar from the time of his remembrance to
this very instant disaster of his setting i the
stocks and what think you he hath confessed

phrase that had the whole theoric of war in the
knot of his scarf and the practise in the chape of

advertisement to a proper maid in florence one
diana to take heed of the allurement of one count
rousillon a foolish idle boy but for all that very
ruttish i pray you sir put it up again


first soldier

nay ill read it first by your favour


parolles

my meaning int i protest was very honest in the
behalf of the maid for i knew the young count to be
a dangerous and lascivious boy who is a whale to
virginity and devours up all the fry it finds


bertram

damnable both-sides rogue


first soldier

reads  when he swears oaths bid him drop gold and take it
after he scores he never pays the score
half won is match well made match and well make it
he neer pays after-debts take it before
and say a soldier dian told thee this
men are to mell with boys are not to kiss

die but that my offences being many i would
repent out the remainder of nature let me live
sir in a dungeon i the stocks or any where so i may live


first soldier

well see what may be done so you confess freely
therefore once more to this captain dumain you
have answered to his reputation with the duke and to
his valour what is his honesty


parolles

he will steal sir an egg out of a cloister for
rapes and ravishments he parallels nessus he
professes not keeping of oaths in breaking em he
is stronger than hercules he will lie sir with
such volubility that you would think truth were a
fool drunkenness is his best virtue for he will
be swine-drunk and in his sleep he does little
harm save to his bed-clothes about him but they
know his conditions and lay him in straw i have but
little more to say sir of his honesty he has
every thing that an honest man should not have what
an honest man should have he has nothing


first lord

i begin to love him for this


bertram

for this description of thine honesty a pox upon
him for me he more and more a cat


first soldier

what say you to his expertness in war


parolles

faith sir he has led the drum before the english
tragedians to belie him i will not and more of
his soldiership i know not except in that country
he had the honour to be the officer at a place there
called mile-end to instruct for the doubling of
files i would do the man what honour i can but of
this i am not certain


first lord

he hath out-villained villany so far that the
rarity redeems him


bertram

a pox on him he a cat still


first soldier

his qualities being at this poor price i need not
to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt


parolles

sir for a quart decu he will sell the fee-simple
of his salvation the inheritance of it and cut the
entail from all remainders and a perpetual
succession for it perpetually


first soldier

what his brother the other captain dumain


second lord

why does be ask him of me


first soldier

what he


parolles

een a crow o the same nest not altogether so
great as the first in goodness but greater a great
deal in evil he excels his brother for a coward
yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is
in a retreat he outruns any lackey marry in coming
on he has the cramp


first soldier

if your life be saved will you undertake to betray
the florentine


parolles

ay and the captain of his horse count rousillon


first soldier

ill whisper with the general and know his pleasure


parolles

aside  ill no more drumming a plague of all
drums only to seem to deserve well and to
beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy
the count have i run into this danger yet who
would have suspected an ambush where i was taken


first soldier

there is no remedy sir but you must die the
general says you that have so traitorously
discovered the secrets of your army and made such
pestiferous reports of men very nobly held can
serve the world for no honest use therefore you
must die come headsman off with his head

countess

tis past my liege
and i beseech your majesty to make it
natural rebellion done i the blaze of youth
when oil and fire too strong for reason force
oerbears it and burns on


king

my honour lady
i have forgiven and forgotten all
though my revenges were high bent upon him
and watch the time to shoot


lafeu

this i must say
but first i beg my pardon the young lord
did to his majesty his mother and his lady
offence of mighty note but to himself
the greatest wrong of all he lost a wife
whose beauty did astonish the survey
of richest eyes whose words all ears took captive
whose dear perfection hearts that scorn to serve
humbly call mistress


king

praising what is lost
makes the remembrance dear well call him hither
we are reconciled and the first view shall kill
all repetition let him not ask our pardon
the nature of his great offence is dead
and deeper than oblivion we do bury
the incensing relics of it let him approach
a stranger no offender and inform him
so tis our will he should

bertram

my high-repented blames
dear sovereign pardon to me


king

all is whole
not one word more of the consumed time
let take the instant by the forward top
for we are old and on our quick decrees
the inaudible and noiseless foot of time
steals ere we can effect them you remember
the daughter of this lord


bertram

admiringly my liege at first
i stuck my choice upon her ere my heart
durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
where the impression of mine eye infixing
contempt his scornful perspective did lend me
which warp the line of every other favour
scorn a fair colour or express it stolen
extended or contracted all proportions
to a most hideous object thence it came
that she whom all men praised and whom myself
since i have lost have loved was in mine eye
the dust that did offend it


king

well excused
that thou didst love her strikes some scores away
from the great compt but love that comes too late
like a remorseful pardon slowly carried
to the great sender turns a sour offence
crying that good that gone our rash faults
make trivial price of serious things we have
not knowing them until we know their grave
oft our displeasures to ourselves unjust
destroy our friends and after weep their dust
our own love waking cries to see what done
while shame full late sleeps out the afternoon
be this sweet helen knell and now forget her
send forth your amorous token for fair maudlin
the main consents are had and here well stay
to see our widower second marriage-day


countess

which better than the first o dear heaven bless
or ere they meet in me o nature cesse

come on my son in whom my house name
must be digested give a favour from you
to sparkle in the spirits of my daughter

hers it was not


king

now pray you let me see it for mine eye
while i was speaking oft was fasten tot
this ring was mine and when i gave it helen
i bade her if her fortunes ever stood
necessitied to help that by this token
i would relieve her had you that craft to reave
her
of what should stead her most


bertram

my gracious sovereign
howeer it pleases you to take it so
the ring was never hers


countess

son on my life
i have seen her wear it and she reckon it
at her life rate


lafeu

i am sure i saw her wear it


bertram

you are deceived my lord she never saw it
in florence was it from a casement thrown me
wrapp in a paper which contain the name
of her that threw it noble she was and thought
i stood engaged but when i had subscribed
to mine own fortune and inform her fully
i could not answer in that course of honour
as she had made the overture she ceased
in heavy satisfaction and would never
receive the ring again


king

plutus himself
that knows the tinct and multiplying medicine
hath not in nature mystery more science
than i have in this ring twas mine twas helen
whoever gave it you then if you know
that you are well acquainted with yourself
confess twas hers and by what rough enforcement
you got it from her she call the saints to surety
that she would never put it from her finger
unless she gave it to yourself in bed
where you have never come or sent it us
upon her great disaster


bertram

she never saw it


king

thou speak it falsely as i love mine honour
and makest conjectural fears to come into me
which i would fain shut out if it should prove
that thou art so inhuman twill not prove so 
and yet i know not thou didst hate her deadly
and she is dead which nothing but to close
her eyes myself could win me to believe
more than to see this ring take him away
guards seize bertram
my fore-past proofs howeer the matter fall
shall tax my fears of little vanity
having vainly fear too little away with him
well sift this matter further


bertram

if you shall prove
this ring was ever hers you shall as easy
prove that i husbanded her bed in florence
where yet she never was
exit guarded


king

i am wrapp in dismal thinkings
enter a gentleman


gentleman

gracious sovereign
whether i have been to blame or no i know not
here a petition from a florentine
who hath for four or five removes come short
to tender it herself i undertook it
vanquish thereto by the fair grace and speech
of the poor suppliant who by this i know
is here attending her business looks in her
with an importing visage and she told me
in a sweet verbal brief it did concern
your highness with herself


king

reads  upon his many protestations to marry me
when his wife was dead i blush to say it he won
me now is the count rousillon a widower his vows
are forfeited to me and my honour paid to him he
stole from florence taking no leave and i follow
him to his country for justice grant it me o
king in you it best lies otherwise a seducer
flourishes and a poor maid is undone
diana capilet


lafeu

both suffer under this complaint we bring
and both shall cease without your remedy


king

bertram

diana

if you shall marry
you give away this hand and that is mine
you give away heaven vows and those are mine

lafeu

your reputation comes too short for my daughter you
are no husband for her


bertram

my lord this is a fond and desperate creature
whom sometime i have laugh with let your highness
lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
than for to think that i would sink it here


king

sir for my thoughts you have them ill to friend
till your deeds gain them fairer prove your honour
than in my thought it lies


diana

good my lord
ask him upon his oath if he does think
he had not my virginity


king

bertram

she impudent my lord
and was a common gamester to the camp


diana

he does me wrong my lord if i were so
he might have bought me at a common price
do not believe him o behold this ring
whose high respect and rich validity
did lack a parallel yet for all that
he gave it to a commoner o the camp
if i be one


countess

he blushes and tis it
of six preceding ancestors that gem
conferr by testament to the sequent issue
hath it been owed and worn this is his wife
that ring a thousand proofs


king

diana

so bad an instrument his name parolles


lafeu

i saw the man to-day if man he be


king

find him and bring him hither
exit an attendant


bertram

what of him
he quoted for a most perfidious slave
with all the spots o the world tax and debosh
whose nature sickens but to speak a truth
am i or that or this for what hell utter
that will speak any thing


king

she hath that ring of yours


bertram

i think she has certain it is i liked her
and boarded her i the wanton way of youth
she knew her distance and did angle for me
madding my eagerness with her restraint
as all impediments in fancy course
are motives of more fancy and in fine
her infinite cunning with her modern grace
subdued me to her rate she got the ring
and i had that which any inferior might
at market-price have bought


diana

i must be patient
you that have turn off a first so noble wife
may justly diet me i pray you yet
since you lack virtue i will lose a husband
send for your ring i will return it home
and give me mine again


bertram

equivocal companion is this


parolles

lafeu

diana

parolles

faith i know more than ill speak


king

but wilt thou not speak all thou knowest


parolles

yes so please your majesty i did go between them
as i said but more than that he loved her for
indeed he was mad for her and talked of satan and
of limbo and of furies and i know not what yet i
was in that credit with them at that time that i
knew of their going to bed and of other motions
as promising her marriage and things which would
derive me ill will to speak of therefore i will not
speak what i know


king

thou hast spoken all already unless thou canst say
they are married but thou art too fine in thy
evidence therefore stand aside

king

i think thee now some common customer


diana

diana

because he guilty and he is not guilty
he knows i am no maid and hell swear tot
ill swear i am a maid and he knows not
great king i am no strumpet by my life
i am either maid or else this old man wife


king

she does abuse our ears to prison with her


diana

good mother fetch my bail stay royal sir
exit widow
the jeweller that owes the ring is sent for
and he shall surety me but for this lord
who hath abused me as he knows himself
though yet he never harm me here i quit him
he knows himself my bed he hath defiled
and at that time he got his wife with child
dead though she be she feels her young one kick
so there my riddle one that dead is quick
and now behold the meaning
re-enter widow with helena


king

king

to make the even truth in pleasure flow
to diana
if thou be yet a fresh uncropped flower
choose thou thy husband and ill pay thy dower
for i can guess that by thy honest aid
thou keep a wife herself thyself a maid
of that and all the progress more or less
resolvedly more leisure shall express
all yet seems well and if it end so meet
the bitter past more welcome is the sweet
flourish
epilogue


king

with strife to please you day exceeding day

bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns
and as thou sayest charged my brother on his
blessing to breed me well and there begins my
sadness my brother jaques he keeps at school and
report speaks goldenly of his profit for my part
he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more
properly stays me here at home unkept for call you
that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that
differs not from the stalling of an ox his horses
are bred better for besides that they are fair
with their feeding they are taught their manage
and to that end riders dearly hired but i his
brother gain nothing under him but growth for the
which his animals on his dunghills are as much
bound to him as i besides this nothing that he so
plentifully gives me the something that nature gave
me his countenance seems to take from me he lets
me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a
brother and as much as in him lies mines my
gentility with my education this is it adam that
grieves me and the spirit of my father which i
think is within me begins to mutiny against this
servitude i will no longer endure it though yet i
know no wise remedy how to avoid it

shake me up

oliver

orlando

i am no villain i am the youngest son of sir
rowland de boys he was my father and he is thrice
a villain that says such a father begot villains
wert thou not my brother i would not take this hand
from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
tongue for saying so thou hast railed on thyself


adam

oliver

orlando

father charged you in his will to give me good
education you have trained me like a peasant
obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
qualities the spirit of my father grows strong in
me and i will no longer endure it therefore allow
me such exercises as may become a gentleman or
give me the poor allottery my father left me by
testament with that i will go buy my fortunes

enter charles


charles

good morrow to your worship


oliver

good monsieur charles what the new news at the
new court


charles

there no news at the court sir but the old news
that is the old duke is banished by his younger
brother the new duke and three or four loving lords
have put themselves into voluntary exile with him
whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke
therefore he gives them good leave to wander


oliver

can you tell if rosalind the duke daughter be
banished with her father


charles

o no for the duke daughter her cousin so loves
her being ever from their cradles bred together
that she would have followed her exile or have died
to stay behind her she is at the court and no
less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and
never two ladies loved as they do


oliver

where will the old duke live


charles

they say he is already in the forest of arden and
a many merry men with him and there they live like
the old robin hood of england they say many young
gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time
carelessly as they did in the golden world


oliver

what you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke


charles

marry do i sir and i came to acquaint you with a
matter i am given sir secretly to understand
that your younger brother orlando hath a disposition
to come in disguised against me to try a fall
to-morrow sir i wrestle for my credit and he that
escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
well your brother is but young and tender and
for your love i would be loath to foil him as i
must for my own honour if he come in therefore
out of my love to you i came hither to acquaint you
withal that either you might stay him from his
intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
run into in that it is a thing of his own search
and altogether against my will


oliver

charles i thank thee for thy love to me which
thou shalt find i will most kindly requite i had
myself notice of my brother purpose herein and
have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
it but he is resolute ill tell thee charles
it is the stubbornest young fellow of france full
of ambition an envious emulator of every man
good parts a secret and villanous contriver against
me his natural brother therefore use thy
discretion i had as lief thou didst break his neck
as his finger and thou wert best look tot for if
thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
mightily grace himself on thee he will practise
against thee by poison entrap thee by some
treacherous device and never leave thee till he
hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other
for i assure thee and almost with tears i speak
it there is not one so young and so villanous this
day living i speak but brotherly of him but
should i anatomize him to thee as he is i must
blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder


charles

i am heartily glad i came hither to you if he come
to-morrow ill give him his payment if ever he go
alone again ill never wrestle for prize more and
so god keep your worship


oliver

farewell good charles
exit charles
now will i stir this gamester i hope i shall see
an end of him for my soul yet i know not why
hates nothing more than he yet he gentle never
schooled and yet learned full of noble device of
all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much
in the heart of the world and especially of my own
people who best know him that i am altogether
misprised but it shall not be so long this
wrestler shall clear all nothing remains but that
i kindle the boy thither which now ill go about
exit

scene ii lawn before the duke palace

enter celia and rosalind


celia

i pray thee rosalind sweet my coz be merry


rosalind

dear celia i show more mirth than i am mistress of
and would you yet i were merrier unless you could
teach me to forget a banished father you must not
learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure


celia

herein i see thou lovest me not with the full weight
that i love thee if my uncle thy banished father
had banished thy uncle the duke my father so thou
hadst been still with me i could have taught my
love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou
if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
tempered as mine is to thee


rosalind

well i will forget the condition of my estate to
rejoice in yours


celia

you know my father hath no child but i nor none is
like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt
be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy
father perforce i will render thee again in
affection by mine honour i will and when i break
that oath let me turn monster therefore my
sweet rose my dear rose be merry


rosalind

from henceforth i will coz and devise sports let
me see what think you of falling in love


celia

marry i prithee do to make sport withal but
love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport
neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
in honour come off again


rosalind

what shall be our sport then


celia

let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from
her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally


rosalind

i would we could do so for her benefits are
mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman
doth most mistake in her gifts to women


celia

tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce
makes honest and those that she makes honest she
makes very ill-favouredly


rosalind

nay now thou goest from fortune office to
nature fortune reigns in gifts of the world
not in the lineaments of nature
enter touchstone


celia

no when nature hath made a fair creature may she
not by fortune fall into the fire though nature
hath given us wit to flout at fortune hath not
fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument


rosalind

indeed there is fortune too hard for nature when
fortune makes nature natural the cutter-off of
nature wit


celia

peradventure this is not fortune work neither but
nature who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
natural for our whetstone for always the dulness of
the fool is the whetstone of the wits how now
wit whither wander you


touchstone

mistress you must come away to your father


celia

were you made the messenger


touchstone

no by mine honour but i was bid to come for you


rosalind

where learned you that oath fool


touchstone

of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
mustard was naught now ill stand to it the
pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and
yet was not the knight forsworn


celia

how prove you that in the great heap of your
knowledge


rosalind

ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom


touchstone

stand you both forth now stroke your chins and
swear by your beards that i am a knave


celia

by our beards if we had them thou art


touchstone

by my knavery if i had it then i were but if you
swear by that that is not you are not forsworn no
more was this knight swearing by his honour for he
never had any or if he had he had sworn it away
before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard


celia

prithee who ist that thou meanest


touchstone

one that old frederick your father loves


celia

my father love is enough to honour him enough
speak no more of him youll be whipped for taxation
one of these days


touchstone

the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what
wise men do foolishly


celia

by my troth thou sayest true for since the little
wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery
that wise men have makes a great show here comes
monsieur le beau


rosalind

with his mouth full of news


celia

which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young


rosalind

then shall we be news-crammed


celia

all the better we shall be the more marketable
enter le beau
bon jour monsieur le beau what the news


le beau

fair princess you have lost much good sport


celia

le beau

rosalind

touchstone

or as the destinies decree


celia

touchstone

nay if i keep not my rank 


rosalind

thou losest thy old smell


le beau

you amaze me ladies i would have told you of good
wrestling which you have lost the sight of


rosalind

le beau

i will tell you the beginning and if it please
your ladyships you may see the end for the best is
yet to do and here where you are they are coming
to perform it


celia

well the beginning that is dead and buried


le beau

there comes an old man and his three sons 


celia

i could match this beginning with an old tale


le beau

three proper young men of excellent growth and presence


rosalind

with bills on their necks be it known unto all men
by these presents


le beau

the eldest of the three wrestled with charles the
duke wrestler which charles in a moment threw him
and broke three of his ribs that there is little
hope of life in him so he served the second and
so the third yonder they lie the poor old man
their father making such pitiful dole over them
that all the beholders take his part with weeping


rosalind

alas


touchstone

but what is the sport monsieur that the ladies
have lost


le beau

why this that i speak of


touchstone

thus men may grow wiser every day it is the first
time that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport
for ladies


celia

or i i promise thee


rosalind

but is there any else longs to see this broken music
in his sides is there yet another dotes upon
rib-breaking shall we see this wrestling cousin


le beau

appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to
perform it


celia

there is such odds in the man in pity of the
challenger youth i would fain dissuade him but he
will not be entreated speak to him ladies see if

orlando

come but in as others do to try with him the
strength of my youth


celia

young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your
years you have seen cruel proof of this man
strength if you saw yourself with your eyes or
knew yourself with your judgment the fear of your
adventure would counsel you to a more equal
enterprise we pray you for your own sake to
embrace your own safety and give over this attempt


rosalind

do young sir your reputation shall not therefore
be misprised we will make it our suit to the duke
that the wrestling might not go forward


orlando

i beseech you punish me not with your hard
thoughts wherein i confess me much guilty to deny
so fair and excellent ladies any thing but let
your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
trial wherein if i be foiled there is but one
shamed that was never gracious if killed but one
dead that was willing to be so i shall do my
friends no wrong for i have none to lament me the
world no injury for in it i have nothing only in
the world i fill up a place which may be better
supplied when i have made it empty


rosalind

the little strength that i have i would it were with you


celia

and mine to eke out hers


rosalind

fare you well pray heaven i be deceived in you


celia

your heart desires be with you


charles

desirous to lie with his mother earth

to a second that have so mightily persuaded him
from a first


orlando

mocked me before but come your ways

fellow by the leg

exeunt duke frederick train and le beau


celia

rosalind

my father loved sir rowland as his soul
and all the world was of my father mind

ere he should thus have ventured


celia

more than your enemies


celia

o poor orlando thou art overthrown
or charles or something weaker masters thee
re-enter le beau


le beau

good sir i do in friendship counsel you
to leave this place albeit you have deserved
high commendation true applause and love
yet such is now the duke condition
that he misconstrues all that you have done
the duke is humorous what he is indeed
more suits you to conceive than i to speak of


orlando

i thank you sir and pray you tell me this
which of the two was daughter of the duke
that here was at the wrestling


le beau

neither his daughter if we judge by manners
but yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
the other is daughter to the banish duke
and here detain by her usurping uncle
to keep his daughter company whose loves
are dearer than the natural bond of sisters
but i can tell you that of late this duke
hath taen displeasure gainst his gentle niece
grounded upon no other argument
but that the people praise her for her virtues
and pity her for her good father sake
and on my life his malice gainst the lady
will suddenly break forth sir fare you well
hereafter in a better world than this
i shall desire more love and knowledge of you


orlando

i rest much bounden to you fare you well
exit le beau
thus must i from the smoke into the smother
from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother
but heavenly rosalind

curs throw some of them at me come lame me with reasons


rosalind

then there were two cousins laid up when the one
should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
without any


celia

but is all this for your father


rosalind

no some of it is for my child father o how
full of briers is this working-day world


celia

they are but burs cousin thrown upon thee in
holiday foolery if we walk not in the trodden
paths our very petticoats will catch them


rosalind

i could shake them off my coat these burs are in my heart


celia

hem them away


rosalind

i would try if i could cry hem and have him


celia

come come wrestle with thy affections


rosalind

o they take the part of a better wrestler than myself


celia

o a good wish upon you you will try in time in
despite of a fall but turning these jests out of
service let us talk in good earnest is it
possible on such a sudden you should fall into so
strong a liking with old sir rowland youngest son


rosalind

the duke my father loved his father dearly


celia

doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
dearly by this kind of chase i should hate him
for my father hated his father dearly yet i hate
not orlando


rosalind

no faith hate him not for my sake


celia

why should i not doth he not deserve well


rosalind

let me love him for that and do you love him
because i do look here comes the duke


celia

enter duke frederick with lords


duke frederick

mistress dispatch you with your safest haste
and get you from our court


rosalind

duke frederick

you cousin
within these ten days if that thou be found
so near our public court as twenty miles
thou diest for it


rosalind

i do beseech your grace
let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me
if with myself i hold intelligence
or have acquaintance with mine own desires
if that i do not dream or be not frantic 
as i do trust i am not then dear uncle
never so much as in a thought unborn
did i offend your highness


duke frederick

thus do all traitors
if their purgation did consist in words
they are as innocent as grace itself
let it suffice thee that i trust thee not


rosalind

yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor
tell me whereon the likelihood depends


duke frederick

thou art thy father daughter there enough


rosalind

so was i when your highness took his dukedom
so was i when your highness banish him
treason is not inherited my lord
or if we did derive it from our friends
what that to me my father was no traitor
then good my liege mistake me not so much
to think my poverty is treacherous


celia

dear sovereign hear me speak


duke frederick

ay celia we stay her for your sake
else had she with her father ranged along


celia

i did not then entreat to have her stay
it was your pleasure and your own remorse
i was too young that time to value her
but now i know her if she be a traitor
why so am i we still have slept together
rose at an instant learn play eat together
and wheresoever we went like juno swans
still we went coupled and inseparable


duke frederick

she is too subtle for thee and her smoothness
her very silence and her patience
speak to the people and they pity her
thou art a fool she robs thee of thy name
and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
when she is gone then open not thy lips
firm and irrevocable is my doom
which i have pass upon her she is banish


celia

pronounce that sentence then on me my liege
i cannot live out of her company


duke frederick

you are a fool you niece provide yourself
if you outstay the time upon mine honour
and in the greatness of my word you die
exeunt duke frederick and lords


celia

hath banish me his daughter


rosalind

that he hath not


celia

no hath not rosalind lacks then the love
which teacheth thee that thou and i am one
shall we be sunder shall we part sweet girl
no let my father seek another heir
therefore devise with me how we may fly
whither to go and what to bear with us
and do not seek to take your change upon you
to bear your griefs yourself and leave me out
for by this heaven now at our sorrows pale
say what thou canst ill go along with thee


rosalind

why whither shall we go


celia

to seek my uncle in the forest of arden


rosalind

alas what danger will it be to us
maids as we are to travel forth so far
beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold


celia

ill put myself in poor and mean attire
and with a kind of umber smirch my face
the like do you so shall we pass along
and never stir assailants


rosalind

were it not better
because that i am more than common tall
that i did suit me all points like a man
a gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh
a boar-spear in my hand and in my heart
lie there what hidden woman fear there will 
well have a swashing and a martial outside
as many other mannish cowards have
that do outface it with their semblances


celia

what shall i call thee when thou art a man


rosalind

ill have no worse a name than jove own page
and therefore look you call me ganymede
but what will you be call


celia

something that hath a reference to my state
no longer celia but aliena


rosalind

but cousin what if we assay to steal
the clownish fool out of your father court
would he not be a comfort to our travel


celia

hell go along oer the wide world with me
leave me alone to woo him let away
and get our jewels and our wealth together
devise the fittest time and safest way
to hide us from pursuit that will be made
after my flight now go we in content
to liberty and not to banishment

act ii
scene i the forest of arden

enter duke senior amiens and two or three lords like foresters


duke senior

now my co-mates and brothers in exile
hath not old custom made this life more sweet
than that of painted pomp are not these woods
more free from peril than the envious court
here feel we but the penalty of adam
the seasons difference as the icy fang
and churlish chiding of the winter wind
which when it bites and blows upon my body
even till i shrink with cold i smile and say
this is no flattery these are counsellors
that feelingly persuade me what i am
sweet are the uses of adversity
which like the toad ugly and venomous
wears yet a precious jewel in his head
and this our life exempt from public haunt
finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks
sermons in stones and good in every thing
i would not change it


amiens

happy is your grace
that can translate the stubbornness of fortune
into so quiet and so sweet a style


duke senior

come shall we go and kill us venison
and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools
being native burghers of this desert city
should in their own confines with forked heads
have their round haunches gored


first lord

indeed my lord
the melancholy jaques grieves at that
and in that kind swears you do more usurp
than doth your brother that hath banish you
to-day my lord of amiens and myself
did steal behind him as he lay along
under an oak whose antique root peeps out
upon the brook that brawls along this wood
to the which place a poor sequester stag
that from the hunter aim had taen a hurt
did come to languish and indeed my lord
the wretched animal heaved forth such groans
that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
almost to bursting and the big round tears
coursed one another down his innocent nose
in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool
much marked of the melancholy jaques
stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook
augmenting it with tears


duke senior

but what said jaques
did he not moralize this spectacle


first lord

o yes into a thousand similes
first for his weeping into the needless stream
poor deer quoth he thou makest a testament
as worldlings do giving thy sum of more
to that which had too much then being there alone
left and abandon of his velvet friends
tis right quoth he thus misery doth part
the flux of company anon a careless herd
full of the pasture jumps along by him
and never stays to greet him ay quoth jaques
weep on you fat and greasy citizens
tis just the fashion wherefore do you look
upon that poor and broken bankrupt there
thus most invectively he pierceth through
the body of the country city court
yea and of this our life swearing that we
are mere usurpers tyrants and what worse
to fright the animals and to kill them up
in their assign and native dwelling-place


duke senior

and did you leave him in this contemplation


second lord

we did my lord weeping and commenting
upon the sobbing deer


duke senior

show me the place
i love to cope him in these sullen fits
for then he full of matter


first lord

ill bring you to him straight
exeunt

scene ii a room in the palace

enter duke frederick with lords


duke frederick

can it be possible that no man saw them
it cannot be some villains of my court
are of consent and sufferance in this


first lord

i cannot hear of any that did see her
the ladies her attendants of her chamber
saw her abed and in the morning early
they found the bed untreasured of their mistress


second lord

my lord the roynish clown at whom so oft
your grace was wont to laugh is also missing
hisperia the princess gentlewoman
confesses that she secretly oerheard
your daughter and her cousin much commend
the parts and graces of the wrestler
that did but lately foil the sinewy charles
and she believes wherever they are gone
that youth is surely in their company


duke frederick

send to his brother fetch that gallant hither
if he be absent bring his brother to me
ill make him find him do this suddenly
and let not search and inquisition quail
to bring again these foolish runaways

scene iii before oliver house

enter orlando and adam meeting


orlando

who there


adam

what my young master o my gentle master
o my sweet master o you memory
of old sir rowland why what make you here
why are you virtuous why do people love you
and wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant
why would you be so fond to overcome
the bonny priser of the humorous duke
your praise is come too swiftly home before you
know you not master to some kind of men
their graces serve them but as enemies
no more do yours your virtues gentle master
are sanctified and holy traitors to you
o what a world is this when what is comely
envenoms him that bears it


orlando

why what the matter


adam

o unhappy youth
come not within these doors within this roof
the enemy of all your graces lives
your brother no no brother yet the son 
yet not the son i will not call him son
of him i was about to call his father 
hath heard your praises and this night he means
to burn the lodging where you use to lie
and you within it if he fail of that
he will have other means to cut you off
i overheard him and his practises
this is no place this house is but a butchery
abhor it fear it do not enter it


orlando

why whither adam wouldst thou have me go


adam

no matter whither so you come not here


orlando

what wouldst thou have me go and beg my food
or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
a thievish living on the common road
this i must do or know not what to do
yet this i will not do do how i can
i rather will subject me to the malice
of a diverted blood and bloody brother


adam

but do not so i have five hundred crowns
the thrifty hire i saved under your father
which i did store to be my foster-nurse
when service should in my old limbs lie lame
and unregarded age in corners thrown
take that and he that doth the ravens feed
yea providently caters for the sparrow
be comfort to my age here is the gold
and all this i give you let me be your servant
though i look old yet i am strong and lusty
for in my youth i never did apply
hot and rebellious liquors in my blood
nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
the means of weakness and debility
therefore my age is as a lusty winter
frosty but kindly let me go with you
ill do the service of a younger man
in all your business and necessities


orlando

o good old man how well in thee appears
the constant service of the antique world
when service sweat for duty not for meed
thou art not for the fashion of these times
where none will sweat but for promotion
and having that do choke their service up
even with the having it is not so with thee
but poor old man thou prunest a rotten tree
that cannot so much as a blossom yield
in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
but come thy ways well go along together
and ere we have thy youthful wages spent
well light upon some settled low content


adam

master go on and i will follow thee
to the last gasp with truth and loyalty
from seventeen years till now almost fourscore
here lived i but now live here no more
at seventeen years many their fortunes seek
but at fourscore it is too late a week
yet fortune cannot recompense me better
than to die well and not my master debtor

and i mine i remember when i was in love i broke
my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
coming a-night to jane smile and i remember the
kissing of her batlet and the cow dugs that her
pretty chopt hands had milked and i remember the
wooing of a peascod instead of her from whom i took
two cods and giving her them again said with
weeping tears wear these for my sake we that are
true lovers run into strange capers but as all is
mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal in folly

my fortunes were more able to relieve her
but i am shepherd to another man
and do not shear the fleeces that i graze
my master is of churlish disposition
and little recks to find the way to heaven
by doing deeds of hospitality
besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed
are now on sale and at our sheepcote now
by reason of his absence there is nothing
that you will feed on but what is come see

scene vii the forest

a table set out enter duke senior amiens and lords like outlaws


duke senior

i think he be transform into a beast
for i can no where find him like a man


first lord

my lord he is but even now gone hence
here was he merry hearing of a song


duke senior

if he compact of jars grow musical
we shall have shortly discord in the spheres
go seek him tell him i would speak with him
enter jaques


first lord

he saves my labour by his own approach


duke senior

why how now monsieur what a life is this
that your poor friends must woo your company
what you look merrily


jaques

a fool a fool i met a fool i the forest
a motley fool a miserable world
as i do live by food i met a fool
who laid him down and bask him in the sun
and rail on lady fortune in good terms
in good set terms and yet a motley fool
good morrow fool quoth i no sir quoth he
call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune
and then he drew a dial from his poke
and looking on it with lack-lustre eye
says very wisely it is ten oclock
thus we may see quoth he how the world wags
tis but an hour ago since it was nine
and after one hour more twill be eleven
and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe
and then from hour to hour we rot and rot
and thereby hangs a tale when i did hear
the motley fool thus moral on the time
my lungs began to crow like chanticleer
that fools should be so deep-contemplative
and i did laugh sans intermission
an hour by his dial o noble fool
a worthy fool motley the only wear


duke senior

what fool is this


jaques

o worthy fool one that hath been a courtier
and says if ladies be but young and fair
they have the gift to know it and in his brain
which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
after a voyage he hath strange places cramm
with observation the which he vents
in mangled forms o that i were a fool
i am ambitious for a motley coat


duke senior

thou shalt have one


jaques

it is my only suit
provided that you weed your better judgments
of all opinion that grows rank in them
that i am wise i must have liberty
withal as large a charter as the wind
to blow on whom i please for so fools have
and they that are most galled with my folly
they most must laugh and why sir must they so
the why is plain as way to parish church
he that a fool doth very wisely hit
doth very foolishly although he smart
not to seem senseless of the bob if not
the wise man folly is anatomized
even by the squandering glances of the fool
invest me in my motley give me leave
to speak my mind and i will through and through
cleanse the foul body of the infected world
if they will patiently receive my medicine


duke senior

fie on thee i can tell what thou wouldst do


jaques

what for a counter would i do but good


duke senior

most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin
for thou thyself hast been a libertine
as sensual as the brutish sting itself
and all the embossed sores and headed evils
that thou with licence of free foot hast caught
wouldst thou disgorge into the general world


jaques

why who cries out on pride
that can therein tax any private party
doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
till that the weary very means do ebb
what woman in the city do i name
when that i say the city-woman bears
the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders
who can come in and say that i mean her
when such a one as she such is her neighbour
or what is he of basest function
that says his bravery is not of my cost
thinking that i mean him but therein suits
his folly to the mettle of my speech
there then how then what then let me see wherein
my tongue hath wrong him if it do him right
then he hath wrong himself if he be free
why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies
unclaim of any man but who comes here
enter orlando with his sword drawn


orlando

forbear and eat no more


jaques

why i have eat none yet


orlando

nor shalt not till necessity be served


jaques

of what kind should this cock come of


duke senior

art thou thus bolden man by thy distress
or else a rude despiser of good manners
that in civility thou seem so empty


orlando

you touch my vein at first the thorny point
of bare distress hath taen from me the show
of smooth civility yet am i inland bred
and know some nurture but forbear i say
he dies that touches any of this fruit
till i and my affairs are answered


jaques

an you will not be answered with reason i must die


duke senior

what would you have your gentleness shall force
more than your force move us to gentleness


orlando

i almost die for food and let me have it


duke senior

sit down and feed and welcome to our table


orlando

speak you so gently pardon me i pray you
i thought that all things had been savage here
and therefore put i on the countenance
of stern commandment but whateer you are
that in this desert inaccessible
under the shade of melancholy boughs
lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
if ever you have look on better days
if ever been where bells have knoll to church
if ever sat at any good man feast
if ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
and know what tis to pity and be pitied
let gentleness my strong enforcement be
in the which hope i blush and hide my sword


duke senior

true is it that we have seen better days
and have with holy bell been knoll to church
and sat at good men feasts and wiped our eyes
of drops that sacred pity hath engender
and therefore sit you down in gentleness
and take upon command what help we have
that to your wanting may be minister


orlando

then but forbear your food a little while
whiles like a doe i go to find my fawn
and give it food there is an old poor man
who after me hath many a weary step
limp in pure love till he be first sufficed
oppress with two weak evils age and hunger
i will not touch a bit


duke senior

go find him out
and we will nothing waste till you return


orlando

i thank ye and be blest for your good comfort
exit


duke senior

thou seest we are not all alone unhappy
this wide and universal theatre
presents more woeful pageants than the scene
wherein we play in


jaques

all the world a stage
and all the men and women merely players
they have their exits and their entrances
and one man in his time plays many parts
his acts being seven ages at first the infant
mewling and puking in the nurse arms
and then the whining school-boy with his satchel
and shining morning face creeping like snail
unwillingly to school and then the lover
sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad
made to his mistress eyebrow then a soldier
full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel
seeking the bubble reputation
even in the cannon mouth and then the justice
in fair round belly with good capon lined
with eyes severe and beard of formal cut
full of wise saws and modern instances
and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts
into the lean and slipper pantaloon
with spectacles on nose and pouch on side
his youthful hose well saved a world too wide
for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice
turning again toward childish treble pipes
and whistles in his sound last scene of all
that ends this strange eventful history
is second childishness and mere oblivion
sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything
re-enter orlando with adam


duke senior

welcome set down your venerable burthen
and let him feed


orlando

i thank you most for him


adam

so had you need
i scarce can speak to thank you for myself


duke senior

welcome fall to i will not trouble you
as yet to question you about your fortunes
give us some music and good cousin sing
song


amiens

blow blow thou winter wind
thou art not so unkind
as man ingratitude
thy tooth is not so keen
because thou art not seen
although thy breath be rude
heigh-ho sing heigh-ho unto the green holly
most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
then heigh-ho the holly
this life is most jolly
freeze freeze thou bitter sky
that dost not bite so nigh
as benefits forgot
though thou the waters warp
thy sting is not so sharp
as friend remember not

scene ii the forest

enter orlando with a paper


orlando

hang there my verse in witness of my love
and thou thrice-crowned queen of night survey
with thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above
thy huntress name that my full life doth sway

and in their barks my thoughts ill character
that every eye which in this forest looks
shall see thy virtue witness every where
run run orlando carve on every tree

exit
enter corin and touchstone


corin

and how like you this shepherd life master touchstone


touchstone

truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good
life but in respect that it is a shepherd life
it is naught in respect that it is solitary i
like it very well but in respect that it is
private it is a very vile life now in respect it
is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in
respect it is not in the court it is tedious as
is it a spare life look you it fits my humour well
but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much
against my stomach hast any philosophy in thee shepherd


corin

no more but that i know the more one sickens the
worse at ease he is and that he that wants money
means and content is without three good friends
that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a
great cause of the night is lack of the sun that
he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred


touchstone

such a one is a natural philosopher wast ever in
court shepherd


corin

no truly


touchstone

then thou art damned


corin

nay i hope


touchstone

truly thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg all
on one side


corin

for not being at court your reason


touchstone

why if thou never wast at court thou never sawest
good manners if thou never sawest good manners
then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is
sin and sin is damnation thou art in a parlous
state shepherd


corin

not a whit touchstone those that are good manners
at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
behavior of the country is most mockable at the
court you told me you salute not at the court but
you kiss your hands that courtesy would be
uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds


touchstone

instance briefly come instance


corin

why we are still handling our ewes and their
fells you know are greasy


touchstone

why do not your courtier hands sweat and is not
the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
a man shallow shallow a better instance i say come


corin

besides our hands are hard


touchstone

your lips will feel them the sooner shallow again
a more sounder instance come


corin

and they are often tarred over with the surgery of
our sheep and would you have us kiss tar the
courtier hands are perfumed with civet


touchstone

most shallow man thou worms-meat in respect of a
good piece of flesh indeed learn of the wise and
perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar the
very uncleanly flux of a cat mend the instance shepherd


corin

you have too courtly a wit for me ill rest


touchstone

wilt thou rest damned god help thee shallow man
god make incision in thee thou art raw


corin

sir i am a true labourer i earn that i eat get
that i wear owe no man hate envy no man
happiness glad of other men good content with my
harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
graze and my lambs suck


touchstone

that is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes
and the rams together and to offer to get your
living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a
bell-wether and to betray a she-lamb of a
twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram
out of all reasonable match if thou beest not
damned for this the devil himself will have no
shepherds i cannot see else how thou shouldst
cape


corin

here comes young master ganymede my new mistress brother
enter rosalind with a paper reading


rosalind

from the east to western ind
no jewel is like rosalind
her worth being mounted on the wind
through all the world bears rosalind
all the pictures fairest lined
are but black to rosalind
let no fair be kept in mind
but the fair of rosalind


touchstone

ill rhyme you so eight years together dinners and
suppers and sleeping-hours excepted it is the
right butter-women rank to market


rosalind

out fool


touchstone

for a taste
if a hart do lack a hind
let him seek out rosalind
if the cat will after kind
so be sure will rosalind
winter garments must be lined
so must slender rosalind
they that reap must sheaf and bind
then to cart with rosalind
sweetest nut hath sourest rind
such a nut is rosalind
he that sweetest rose will find
must find love prick and rosalind
this is the very false gallop of verses why do you
infect yourself with them


rosalind

peace you dull fool i found them on a tree


touchstone

truly the tree yields bad fruit


rosalind

ill graff it with you and then i shall graff it
with a medlar then it will be the earliest fruit
i the country for youll be rotten ere you be half
ripe and that the right virtue of the medlar


touchstone

you have said but whether wisely or no let the
forest judge
enter celia with a writing


rosalind

peace here comes my sister reading stand aside


celia

reads
why should this a desert be
for it is unpeopled no
tongues ill hang on every tree
that shall civil sayings show
some how brief the life of man
runs his erring pilgrimage
that the stretching of a span
buckles in his sum of age
some of violated vows
twixt the souls of friend and friend
but upon the fairest boughs
or at every sentence end
will i rosalinda write
teaching all that read to know
the quintessence of every sprite
heaven would in little show
therefore heaven nature charged
that one body should be fill
with all graces wide-enlarged
nature presently distill
helen cheek but not her heart
cleopatra majesty
atalanta better part
sad lucretia modesty
thus rosalind of many parts
by heavenly synod was devised
of many faces eyes and hearts
to have the touches dearest prized
heaven would that she these gifts should have
and i to live and die her slave


rosalind

o most gentle pulpiter what tedious homily of love
have you wearied your parishioners withal and never
cried have patience good people


celia

how now back friends shepherd go off a little
go with him sirrah


touchstone

come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat
though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage
exeunt corin and touchstone


celia

didst thou hear these verses


rosalind

o yes i heard them all and more too for some of
them had in them more feet than the verses would bear


celia

that no matter the feet might bear the verses


rosalind

ay but the feet were lame and could not bear
themselves without the verse and therefore stood
lamely in the verse


celia

but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
should be hanged and carved upon these trees


rosalind

i was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
before you came for look here what i found on a
palm-tree i was never so be-rhymed since
pythagoras time that i was an irish rat which i
can hardly remember


celia

trow you who hath done this


rosalind

is it a man


celia

and a chain that you once wore about his neck
change you colour


rosalind

i prithee who


celia

o lord lord it is a hard matter for friends to
meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
and so encounter


rosalind

nay but who is it


celia

is it possible


rosalind

nay i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence
tell me who it is


celia

o wonderful wonderful and most wonderful
wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that
out of all hooping


rosalind

good my complexion dost thou think though i am
caparisoned like a man i have a doublet and hose in
my disposition one inch of delay more is a
south-sea of discovery i prithee tell me who is it
quickly and speak apace i would thou couldst
stammer that thou mightst pour this concealed man
out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow-
mouthed bottle either too much at once or none at
all i prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that
may drink thy tidings


celia

so you may put a man in your belly


rosalind

is he of god making what manner of man is his
head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard


celia

nay he hath but a little beard


rosalind

why god will send more if the man will be
thankful let me stay the growth of his beard if
thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin


celia

it is young orlando that tripped up the wrestler
heels and your heart both in an instant


rosalind

nay but the devil take mocking speak sad brow and
true maid


celia

i faith coz tis he


rosalind

orlando


celia

orlando


rosalind

alas the day what shall i do with my doublet and
hose what did he when thou sawest him what said
he how looked he wherein went he what makes
him here did he ask for me where remains he
how parted he with thee and when shalt thou see
him again answer me in one word


celia

you must borrow me gargantua mouth first tis a
word too great for any mouth of this age size to
say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
answer in a catechism


rosalind

but doth he know that i am in this forest and in
man apparel looks he as freshly as he did the
day he wrestled


celia

it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
propositions of a lover but take a taste of my
finding him and relish it with good observance
i found him under a tree like a dropped acorn


rosalind

it may well be called jove tree when it drops
forth such fruit


celia

give me audience good madam


rosalind

proceed


celia

there lay he stretched along like a wounded knight


rosalind

though it be pity to see such a sight it well
becomes the ground


celia

cry holla to thy tongue i prithee it curvets
unseasonably he was furnished like a hunter


rosalind

o ominous he comes to kill my heart


celia

i would sing my song without a burden thou bringest
me out of tune


rosalind

do you not know i am a woman when i think i must
speak sweet say on


celia

you bring me out soft comes he not here
enter orlando and jaques


rosalind

tis he slink by and note him


jaques

i thank you for your company but good faith i had
as lief have been myself alone


orlando

and so had i but yet for fashion sake i thank you
too for your society


jaques

god be wi you let meet as little as we can


orlando

i do desire we may be better strangers


jaques

i pray you mar no more trees with writing
love-songs in their barks


orlando

i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading
them ill-favouredly


jaques

rosalind is your love name


orlando

yes just


jaques

i do not like her name


orlando

there was no thought of pleasing you when she was
christened


jaques

what stature is she of


orlando

just as high as my heart


jaques

you are full of pretty answers have you not been
acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conned them
out of rings


orlando

not so but i answer you right painted cloth from
whence you have studied your questions


jaques

you have a nimble wit i think twas made of
atalanta heels will you sit down with me and
we two will rail against our mistress the world and
all our misery


orlando

i will chide no breather in the world but myself
against whom i know most faults


jaques

the worst fault you have is to be in love


orlando

tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue
i am weary of you


jaques

by my troth i was seeking for a fool when i found
you


orlando

he is drowned in the brook look but in and you
shall see him


jaques

there i shall see mine own figure


orlando

which i take to be either a fool or a cipher


jaques

ill tarry no longer with you farewell good
signior love


orlando

i am glad of your departure adieu good monsieur
melancholy
exit jaques


rosalind

aside to celia  i will speak to him like a saucy
lackey and under that habit play the knave with him
do you hear forester


orlando

very well what would you


rosalind

i pray you what ist oclock


orlando

you should ask me what time o day there no clock
in the forest


rosalind

then there is no true lover in the forest else
sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock


orlando

and why not the swift foot of time had not that
been as proper


rosalind

by no means sir time travels in divers paces with
divers persons ill tell you who time ambles
withal who time trots withal who time gallops
withal and who he stands still withal


orlando

i prithee who doth he trot withal


rosalind

marry he trots hard with a young maid between the
contract of her marriage and the day it is
solemnized if the interim be but a sennight
time pace is so hard that it seems the length of
seven year


orlando

who ambles time withal


rosalind

with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that
hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because
he cannot study and the other lives merrily because
he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean
and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden
of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal


orlando

who doth he gallop withal


rosalind

with a thief to the gallows for though he go as
softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there


orlando

who stays it still withal


rosalind

with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between
term and term and then they perceive not how time moves


orlando

where dwell you pretty youth


rosalind

with this shepherdess my sister here in the
skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat


orlando

are you native of this place


rosalind

as the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled


orlando

your accent is something finer than you could
purchase in so removed a dwelling


rosalind

i have been told so of many but indeed an old
religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was
in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship
too well for there he fell in love i have heard
him read many lectures against it and i thank god
i am not a woman to be touched with so many
giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
whole sex withal


orlando

can you remember any of the principal evils that he
laid to the charge of women


rosalind

there were none principal they were all like one
another as half-pence are every one fault seeming
monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it


orlando

i prithee recount some of them


rosalind

no i will not cast away my physic but on those that
are sick there is a man haunts the forest that
abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on
their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of
rosalind if i could meet that fancy-monger i would
give him some good counsel for he seems to have the
quotidian of love upon him


orlando

i am he that is so love-shaked i pray you tell me
your remedy


rosalind

there is none of my uncle marks upon you he
taught me how to know a man in love in which cage
of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner


orlando

what were his marks


rosalind

a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and
sunken which you have not an unquestionable
spirit which you have not a beard neglected
which you have not but i pardon you for that for
simply your having in beard is a younger brother
revenue then your hose should be ungartered your
bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe
untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
careless desolation but you are no such man you
are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other


orlando

fair youth i would i could make thee believe i love


rosalind

me believe it you may as soon make her that you
love believe it which i warrant she is apter to
do than to confess she does that is one of the
points in the which women still give the lie to
their consciences but in good sooth are you he
that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind
is so admired


orlando

i swear to thee youth by the white hand of
rosalind i am that he that unfortunate he


rosalind

but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak


orlando

neither rhyme nor reason can express how much


rosalind

love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves
as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and
the reason why they are not so punished and cured
is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
are in love too yet i profess curing it by counsel


orlando

did you ever cure any so


rosalind

yes one and in this manner he was to imagine me
his love his mistress and i set him every day to
woo me at which time would i being but a moonish
youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing
and liking proud fantastical apish shallow
inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every
passion something and for no passion truly any
thing as boys and women are for the most part
cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe
him then entertain him then forswear him now weep
for him then spit at him that i drave my suitor
from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
madness which was to forswear the full stream of
the world and to live in a nook merely monastic
and thus i cured him and this way will i take upon
me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep
heart that there shall not be one spot of love int


orlando

i would not be cured youth


rosalind

i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind
and come every day to my cote and woo me


orlando

now by the faith of my love i will tell me
where it is


rosalind

go with me to it and ill show it you and by the way
you shall tell me where in the forest you live
will you go


orlando

with all my heart good youth


rosalind

nay you must call me rosalind come sister will you go

enter touchstone and audrey jaques behind


touchstone

come apace good audrey i will fetch up your
goats audrey and how audrey am i the man yet
doth my simple feature content you


audrey

your features lord warrant us what features


touchstone

i am here with thee and thy goats as the most
capricious poet honest ovid was among the goths


jaques

aside  o knowledge ill-inhabited worse than jove
in a thatched house


touchstone

when a man verses cannot be understood nor a
man good wit seconded with the forward child
understanding it strikes a man more dead than a
great reckoning in a little room truly i would
the gods had made thee poetical


audrey

i do not know what poetical is is it honest in
deed and word is it a true thing


touchstone

no truly for the truest poetry is the most
feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what
they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign


audrey

do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical


touchstone

i do truly for thou swearest to me thou art
honest now if thou wert a poet i might have some
hope thou didst feign


audrey

would you not have me honest


touchstone

no truly unless thou wert hard-favoured for
honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar


jaques

aside  a material fool


audrey

well i am not fair and therefore i pray the gods
make me honest


touchstone

truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
were to put good meat into an unclean dish


audrey

i am not a slut though i thank the gods i am foul


touchstone

well praised be the gods for thy foulness
sluttishness may come hereafter but be it as it may
be i will marry thee and to that end i have been
with sir oliver martext the vicar of the next
village who hath promised to meet me in this place
of the forest and to couple us


jaques

aside  i would fain see this meeting


audrey

well the gods give us joy


touchstone

amen a man may if he were of a fearful heart
stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple
but the wood no assembly but horn-beasts but what
though c ourage as horns are odious they are
necessary it is said many a man knows no end of
his goods right many a man has good horns and
knows no end of them well that is the dowry of
his wife tis none of his own getting horns
even so poor men alone no no the noblest deer
hath them as huge as the rascal is the single man
therefore blessed no as a walled town is more
worthier than a village so is the forehead of a
married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
bachelor and by how much defence is better than no
skill by so much is a horn more precious than to
want here comes sir oliver
enter sir oliver martext
sir oliver martext you are well met will you
dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go
with you to your chapel


sir oliver martext

is there none here to give the woman


touchstone

i will not take her on gift of any man


sir oliver martext

truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful


jaques

advancing
proceed proceedill give her


touchstone

good even good master what-ye-callt how do you
sir you are very well met god ild you for your
last company i am very glad to see you even a
toy in hand here sir nay pray be covered


jaques

will you be married motley


touchstone

as the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and
the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and
as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibbling


jaques

and will you being a man of your breeding be
married under a bush like a beggar get you to
church and have a good priest that can tell you
what marriage is this fellow will but join you
together as they join wainscot then one of you will
prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp


touchstone

aside  i am not in the mind but i were better to be
married of him than of another for he is not like
to marry me well and not being well married it
will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife


jaques

go thou with me and let me counsel thee


touchstone

come sweet audrey
we must be married or we must live in bawdry
farewell good master oliver not

scene iv the forest

enter rosalind and celia


rosalind

never talk to me i will weep


celia

do i prithee but yet have the grace to consider
that tears do not become a man


rosalind

but have i not cause to weep


celia

as good cause as one would desire therefore weep


rosalind

his very hair is of the dissembling colour


celia

something browner than judas marry his kisses are
judas own children


rosalind

i faith his hair is of a good colour


celia

an excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour


rosalind

and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
of holy bread


celia

he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana a nun
of winter sisterhood kisses not more religiously
the very ice of chastity is in them


rosalind

but why did he swear he would come this morning and
comes not


celia

nay certainly there is no truth in him


rosalind

do you think so


celia

yes i think he is not a pick-purse nor a
horse-stealer but for his verity in love i do
think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
worm-eaten nut


rosalind

not true in love


celia

yes when he is in but i think he is not in


rosalind

you have heard him swear downright he was


celia

was is not is besides the oath of a lover is
no stronger than the word of a tapster they are
both the confirmer of false reckonings he attends
here in the forest on the duke your father


rosalind

i met the duke yesterday and had much question with
him he asked me of what parentage i was i told
him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go
but what talk we of fathers when there is such a
man as orlando


celia

o that a brave man he writes brave verses
speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks
them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of
his lover as a puisny tilter that spurs his horse
but on one side breaks his staff like a noble
goose but all brave that youth mounts and folly
guides who comes here

corin

mistress and master you have oft inquired
after the shepherd that complain of love
who you saw sitting by me on the turf
praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
that was his mistress


celia

well and what of him


corin

if you will see a pageant truly play
between the pale complexion of true love
and the red glow of scorn and proud disdain
go hence a little and i shall conduct you
if you will mark it


rosalind

o come let us remove
the sight of lovers feedeth those in love
bring us to this sight and you shall say
ill prove a busy actor in their play

silvius

sweet phebe do not scorn me do not phebe
say that you love me not but say not so
in bitterness the common executioner
whose heart the accustom sight of death makes hard
falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
but first begs pardon will you sterner be
than he that dies and lives by bloody drops
enter rosalind celia and corin behind


phebe

i would not be thy executioner
i fly thee for i would not injure thee
thou tell me there is murder in mine eye
tis pretty sure and very probable
that eyes that are the frail and softest things
who shut their coward gates on atomies
should be call tyrants butchers murderers
now i do frown on thee with all my heart
and if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee
now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down
or if thou canst not o for shame for shame
lie not to say mine eyes are murderers
now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee
scratch thee but with a pin and there remains
some scar of it lean but upon a rush
the cicatrice and capable impressure
thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes
which i have darted at thee hurt thee not
nor i am sure there is no force in eyes
that can do hurt


silvius

o dear phebe
if ever as that ever may be near 
you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy
then shall you know the wounds invisible
that love keen arrows make


phebe

but till that time
come not thou near me and when that time comes
afflict me with thy mocks pity me not
as till that time i shall not pity thee


rosalind

and why i pray you who might be your mother
that you insult exult and all at once
over the wretched what though you have no beauty 
as by my faith i see no more in you
than without candle may go dark to bed 
must you be therefore proud and pitiless
why what means this why do you look on me
i see no more in you than in the ordinary
of nature sale-work od my little life
i think she means to tangle my eyes too
no faith proud mistress hope not after it
tis not your inky brows your black silk hair
your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream
that can entame my spirits to your worship
you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her
like foggy south puffing with wind and rain
you are a thousand times a properer man
than she a woman tis such fools as you
that makes the world full of ill-favour children
tis not her glass but you that flatters her
and out of you she sees herself more proper
than any of her lineaments can show her
but mistress know yourself down on your knees
and thank heaven fasting for a good man love
for i must tell you friendly in your ear
sell when you can you are not for all markets
cry the man mercy love him take his offer
foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer
so take her to thee shepherd fare you well


phebe

sweet youth i pray you chide a year together
i had rather hear you chide than this man woo


rosalind

he fallen in love with your foulness and shell
fall in love with my anger if it be so as fast as
she answers thee with frowning looks ill sauce her
with bitter words why look you so upon me


phebe

for no ill will i bear you


rosalind

i pray you do not fall in love with me
for i am falser than vows made in wine
besides i like you not if you will know my house
tis at the tuft of olives here hard by
will you go sister shepherd ply her hard
come sister shepherdess look on him better
and be not proud though all the world could see
none could be so abused in sight as he
come to our flock
exeunt rosalind celia and corin

why i am sorry for thee gentle silvius


silvius

wherever sorrow is relief would be
if you do sorrow at my grief in love
by giving love your sorrow and my grief
were both extermined


phebe

thou hast my love is not that neighbourly


silvius

i would have you


phebe

why that were covetousness
silvius the time was that i hated thee
and yet it is not that i bear thee love
but since that thou canst talk of love so well
thy company which erst was irksome to me
i will endure and ill employ thee too
but do not look for further recompense
than thine own gladness that thou art employ


silvius

so holy and so perfect is my love
and i in such a poverty of grace
that i shall think it a most plenteous crop
to glean the broken ears after the man
that the main harvest reaps loose now and then
a scatter smile and that ill live upon


phebe

know now the youth that spoke to me erewhile


silvius

not very well but i have met him oft
and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
that the old carlot once was master of


phebe

think not i love him though i ask for him
tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well
but what care i for words yet words do well
when he that speaks them pleases those that hear
it is a pretty youth not very pretty
but sure he proud and yet his pride becomes him
hell make a proper man the best thing in him
is his complexion and faster than his tongue
did make offence his eye did heal it up
he is not very tall yet for his years he tall
his leg is but so so and yet tis well
there was a pretty redness in his lip
a little riper and more lusty red
than that mix in his cheek twas just the difference
between the constant red and mingled damask
there be some women silvius had they mark him
in parcels as i did would have gone near
to fall in love with him but for my part
i love him not nor hate him not and yet
i have more cause to hate him than to love him
for what had he to do to chide at me
he said mine eyes were black and my hair black
and now i am remember scorn at me
i marvel why i answer not again
but that all one omittance is no quittance
ill write to him a very taunting letter
and thou shalt bear it wilt thou silvius


silvius

phebe with all my heart


phebe

ill write it straight
the matter in my head and in my heart
i will be bitter with him and passing short
go with me silvius

act iv
scene i the forest

enter rosalind celia and jaques


jaques

i prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted
with thee


rosalind

they say you are a melancholy fellow


jaques

i am so i do love it better than laughing


rosalind

those that are in extremity of either are abominable
fellows and betray themselves to every modern
censure worse than drunkards


jaques

why tis good to be sad and say nothing


rosalind

why then tis good to be a post


jaques

i have neither the scholar melancholy which is
emulation nor the musician which is fantastical
nor the courtier which is proud nor the
soldier which is ambitious nor the lawyer
which is politic nor the lady which is nice nor
the lover which is all these but it is a
melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples
extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry
contemplation of my travels in which my often
rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness


rosalind

a traveller by my faith you have great reason to
be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see
other men then to have seen much and to have
nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands


jaques

yes i have gained my experience


rosalind

and your experience makes you sad i had rather have
a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
sad and to travel for it too
enter orlando


orlando

good day and happiness dear rosalind


jaques

nay then god be wi you an you talk in blank verse
exit


rosalind

farewell monsieur traveller look you lisp and
wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your
own country be out of love with your nativity and
almost chide god for making you that countenance you
are or i will scarce think you have swam in a
gondola why how now orlando where have you been
all this while you a lover an you serve me such
another trick never come in my sight more


orlando

my fair rosalind i come within an hour of my promise


rosalind

break an hour promise in love he that will
divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
affairs of love it may be said of him that cupid
hath clapped him o the shoulder but ill warrant
him heart-whole


orlando

pardon me dear rosalind


rosalind

nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight i
had as lief be wooed of a snail


orlando

of a snail


rosalind

ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he
carries his house on his head a better jointure
i think than you make a woman besides he brings
his destiny with him


orlando

what that


rosalind

why horns which such as you are fain to be
beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in
his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife


orlando

virtue is no horn-maker and my rosalind is virtuous


rosalind

and i am your rosalind


celia

it pleases him to call you so but he hath a
rosalind of a better leer than you


rosalind

come woo me woo me for now i am in a holiday
humour and like enough to consent what would you
say to me now an i were your very very rosalind


orlando

i would kiss before i spoke


rosalind

nay you were better speak first and when you were
gravelled for lack of matter you might take
occasion to kiss very good orators when they are
out they will spit and for lovers lacking god
warn us matter the cleanliest shift is to kiss


orlando

how if the kiss be denied


rosalind

then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter


orlando

who could be out being before his beloved mistress


rosalind

marry that should you if i were your mistress or
i should think my honesty ranker than my wit


orlando

what of my suit


rosalind

not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit
am not i your rosalind


orlando

i take some joy to say you are because i would be
talking of her


rosalind

well in her person i say i will not have you


orlando

then in mine own person i die


rosalind

no faith die by attorney the poor world is
almost six thousand years old and in all this time
there was not any man died in his own person
videlicit in a love-cause troilus had his brains
dashed out with a grecian club yet he did what he
could to die before and he is one of the patterns
of love leander he would have lived many a fair
year though hero had turned nun if it had not been
for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went
but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being
taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
coroners of that age found it was hero of sestos
but these are all lies men have died from time to
time and worms have eaten them but not for love


orlando

i would not have my right rosalind of this mind
for i protest her frown might kill me


rosalind

by this hand it will not kill a fly but come now
i will be your rosalind in a more coming-on
disposition and ask me what you will i will grant
it


orlando

then love me rosalind


rosalind

yes faith will i fridays and saturdays and all


orlando

and wilt thou have me


rosalind

ay and twenty such


orlando

what sayest thou


rosalind

are you not good


orlando

i hope so


rosalind

why then can one desire too much of a good thing
come sister you shall be the priest and marry us
give me your hand orlando what do you say sister


orlando

pray thee marry us


celia

i cannot say the words


rosalind

you must begin will you orlando 


celia

go to will you orlando have to wife this rosalind


orlando

i will


rosalind

ay but when


orlando

why now as fast as she can marry us


rosalind

then you must say i take thee rosalind for wife


orlando

i take thee rosalind for wife


rosalind

i might ask you for your commission but i do take
thee orlando for my husband there a girl goes
before the priest and certainly a woman thought
runs before her actions


orlando

so do all thoughts they are winged


rosalind

now tell me how long you would have her after you
have possessed her


orlando

for ever and a day


rosalind

say a day without the ever no no orlando
men are april when they woo december when they wed
maids are may when they are maids but the sky
changes when they are wives i will be more jealous
of thee than a barbary cock-pigeon over his hen
more clamorous than a parrot against rain more
new-fangled than an ape more giddy in my desires
than a monkey i will weep for nothing like diana
in the fountain and i will do that when you are
disposed to be merry i will laugh like a hyen and
that when thou art inclined to sleep


orlando

but will my rosalind do so


rosalind

by my life she will do as i do


orlando

o but she is wise


rosalind

or else she could not have the wit to do this the
wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a woman
wit and it will out at the casement shut that and
twill out at the key-hole stop that twill fly
with the smoke out at the chimney


orlando

a man that had a wife with such a wit he might say
wit whither wilt


rosalind

nay you might keep that cheque for it till you met
your wife wit going to your neighbour bed


orlando

and what wit could wit have to excuse that


rosalind

marry to say she came to seek you there you shall
never take her without her answer unless you take
her without her tongue o that woman that cannot
make her fault her husband occasion let her
never nurse her child herself for she will breed
it like a fool


orlando

for these two hours rosalind i will leave thee


rosalind

alas dear love i cannot lack thee two hours


orlando

i must attend the duke at dinner by two oclock i
will be with thee again


rosalind

ay go your ways go your ways i knew what you
would prove my friends told me as much and i
thought no less that flattering tongue of yours
won me tis but one cast away and so come
death two oclock is your hour


orlando

ay sweet rosalind


rosalind

by my troth and in good earnest and so god mend
me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous
if you break one jot of your promise or come one
minute behind your hour i will think you the most
pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover
and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that
may be chosen out of the gross band of the
unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep
your promise


orlando

with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
rosalind so adieu


rosalind

well time is the old justice that examines all such
offenders and let time try adieu
exit orlando


celia

you have simply misused our sex in your love-prate
we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
head and show the world what the bird hath done to
her own nest


rosalind

o coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou
didst know how many fathom deep i am in love but
it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown
bottom like the bay of portugal


celia

or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour
affection in it runs out


rosalind

no that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot
of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness
that blind rascally boy that abuses every one eyes
because his own are out let him be judge how deep i
am in love ill tell thee aliena i cannot be out
of the sight of orlando ill go find a shadow and
sigh till he come

enter silvius


silvius

my errand is to you fair youth
my gentle phebe bid me give you this
i know not the contents but as i guess
by the stern brow and waspish action
which she did use as she was writing of it
it bears an angry tenor pardon me
i am but as a guiltless messenger


rosalind

patience herself would startle at this letter
and play the swaggerer bear this bear all
she says i am not fair that i lack manners
she calls me proud and that she could not love me
were man as rare as phoenix od my will
her love is not the hare that i do hunt
why writes she so to me well shepherd well
this is a letter of your own device


silvius

no i protest i know not the contents
phebe did write it


rosalind

come come you are a fool
and turn into the extremity of love
i saw her hand she has a leathern hand
a freestone-colour hand i verily did think
that her old gloves were on but twas her hands
she has a huswife hand but that no matter
i say she never did invent this letter
this is a man invention and his hand


silvius

sure it is hers


rosalind

why tis a boisterous and a cruel style
a style for-challengers why she defies me
like turk to christian women gentle brain
could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
such ethiope words blacker in their effect
than in their countenance will you hear the letter


silvius

so please you for i never heard it yet
yet heard too much of phebe cruelty


rosalind

she phebes me mark how the tyrant writes
reads
art thou god to shepherd turn
that a maiden heart hath burn
can a woman rail thus


silvius

call you this railing


rosalind

reads
why thy godhead laid apart
warr thou with a woman heart
did you ever hear such railing
whiles the eye of man did woo me
that could do no vengeance to me
meaning me a beast
if the scorn of your bright eyne
have power to raise such love in mine
alack in me what strange effect
would they work in mild aspect
whiles you chid me i did love
how then might your prayers move
he that brings this love to thee
little knows this love in me
and by him seal up thy mind
whether that thy youth and kind
will the faithful offer take
of me and all that i can make
or else by him my love deny
and then ill study how to die


silvius

call you this chiding


celia

alas poor shepherd


rosalind

do you pity him no he deserves no pity wilt
thou love such a woman what to make thee an
instrument and play false strains upon thee not to
be endured well go your way to her for i see
love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to
her that if she love me i charge her to love
thee if she will not i will never have her unless
thou entreat for her if you be a true lover
hence and not a word for here comes more company

oliver

good morrow fair ones pray you if you know
where in the purlieus of this forest stands
a sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees


celia

west of this place down in the neighbour bottom
the rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
left on your right hand brings you to the place
but at this hour the house doth keep itself
there none within


oliver

if that an eye may profit by a tongue
then should i know you by description
such garments and such years the boy is fair
of female favour and bestows himself
like a ripe sister the woman low
and browner than her brother are not you
the owner of the house i did inquire for


celia

it is no boast being ask to say we are


oliver

orlando doth commend him to you both
and to that youth he calls his rosalind
he sends this bloody napkin are you he


rosalind

i am what must we understand by this


oliver

some of my shame if you will know of me
what man i am and how and why and where
this handkercher was stain


celia

i pray you tell it


oliver

when last the young orlando parted from you
he left a promise to return again
within an hour and pacing through the forest
chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy
lo what befell he threw his eye aside
and mark what object did present itself
under an oak whose boughs were moss with age
and high top bald with dry antiquity
a wretched ragged man oergrown with hair
lay sleeping on his back about his neck
a green and gilded snake had wreathed itself
who with her head nimble in threats approach
the opening of his mouth but suddenly
seeing orlando it unlink itself
and with indented glides did slip away
into a bush under which bush shade
a lioness with udders all drawn dry
lay couching head on ground with catlike watch
when that the sleeping man should stir for tis
the royal disposition of that beast
to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead
this seen orlando did approach the man
and found it was his brother his elder brother


celia

o i have heard him speak of that same brother
and he did render him the most unnatural
that lived amongst men


oliver

and well he might so do
for well i know he was unnatural


rosalind

but to orlando did he leave him there
food to the suck and hungry lioness


oliver

twice did he turn his back and purposed so
but kindness nobler ever than revenge
and nature stronger than his just occasion
made him give battle to the lioness
who quickly fell before him in which hurtling
from miserable slumber i awaked


celia

are you his brother


rosalind

wast you he rescued


celia

wast you that did so oft contrive to kill him


oliver

twas i but tis not ii do not shame
to tell you what i was since my conversion
so sweetly tastes being the thing i am


rosalind

but for the bloody napkin


oliver

by and by
when from the first to last betwixt us two
tears our recountments had most kindly bathed
as how i came into that desert place 
in brief he led me to the gentle duke
who gave me fresh array and entertainment
committing me unto my brother love
who led me instantly unto his cave
there stripp himself and here upon his arm
the lioness had torn some flesh away
which all this while had bled and now he fainted
and cried in fainting upon rosalind
brief i recover him bound up his wound
and after some small space being strong at heart
he sent me hither stranger as i am
to tell this story that you might excuse
his broken promise and to give this napkin
dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
that he in sport doth call his rosalind
rosalind swoons


celia

why how now ganymede sweet ganymede


oliver

many will swoon when they do look on blood


celia

there is more in it cousin ganymede


oliver

look he recovers


rosalind

i would i were at home


celia

well lead you thither
i pray you will you take him by the arm


oliver

man heart


rosalind

i do so i confess it ah sirrah a body would
think this was well counterfeited i pray you tell
your brother how well i counterfeited heigh-ho


oliver

testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
of earnest


rosalind

oliver

well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man


rosalind

so i do but i faith i should have been a woman by right


celia

overcame for your brother and my sister no sooner
met but they looked no sooner looked but they
loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner
sighed but they asked one another the reason no

to marriage which they will climb incontinent or
else be incontinent before marriage they are in
the very wrath of love and they will together clubs
cannot part them


orlando

they shall be married to-morrow and i will bid the
duke to the nuptial but o how bitter a thing it

yourself good and not to grace me believe then if
you please that i can do strange things i have

magician most profound in his art and yet not
damnable if you do love rosalind so near the heart

marries aliena shall you marry her i know into
what straits of fortune she is driven and it is
not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient
to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human

in spring time   c
this carol they began that hour
with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino

jaques

but for the seventh cause how did you find the
quarrel on the seventh cause


touchstone

upon a lie seven times removed bear your body more
seeming audrey as thus sir i did dislike the
cut of a certain courtier beard he sent me word
if i said his beard was not cut well he was in the
mind it was this is called the retort courteous
if i sent him word again it was not well cut he
would send me word he cut it to please himself
this is called the quip modest if again it was
not well cut he disabled my judgment this is
called the reply churlish if again it was not
well cut he would answer i spake not true this
is called the reproof valiant if again it was not
well cut he would say i lied this is called the
counter-cheque quarrelsome and so to the lie
circumstantial and the lie direct


jaques

and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut


touchstone

i durst go no further than the lie circumstantial
nor he durst not give me the lie direct and so we
measured swords and parted


jaques

can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie


touchstone

o sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have
books for good manners i will name you the degrees
the first the retort courteous the second the
quip modest the third the reply churlish the
fourth the reproof valiant the fifth the
countercheque quarrelsome the sixth the lie with
circumstance the seventh the lie direct all
these you may avoid but the lie direct and you may
avoid that too with an if i knew when seven
justices could not take up a quarrel but when the
parties were met themselves one of them thought but
of an if as if you said so then i said so and
they shook hands and swore brothers your if is the
only peacemaker much virtue in if

let me have audience for a word or two
i am the second son of old sir rowland
that bring these tidings to this fair assembly
duke frederick hearing how that every day
men of great worth resorted to this forest
address a mighty power which were on foot
in his own conduct purposely to take
his brother here and put him to the sword
and to the skirts of this wild wood he came
where meeting with an old religious man
after some question with him was converted
both from his enterprise and from the world
his crown bequeathing to his banish brother
and all their lands restored to them again
that were with him exiled this to be true
i do engage my life


duke senior

welcome young man
thou offer fairly to thy brothers wedding
to one his lands withheld and to the other
a land itself at large a potent dukedom
first in this forest let us do those ends
that here were well begun and well begot
and after every of this happy number
that have endured shrewd days and nights with us
shall share the good of our returned fortune
according to the measure of their states
meantime forget this new-falln dignity
and fall into our rustic revelry
play music and you brides and bridegrooms all
with measure heap in joy to the measures fall


jaques

sir by your patience if i heard you rightly
the duke hath put on a religious life
and thrown into neglect the pompous court


jaques de boys

epilogue


rosalind

it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue
but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord
the prologue if it be true that good wine needs
no bush tis true that a good play needs no
epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes
and good plays prove the better by the help of good
epilogues what a case am i in then that am
neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
you in the behalf of a good play i am not
furnished like a beggar therefore to beg will not
become me my way is to conjure you and ill begin
with the women i charge you o women for the love
you bear to men to like as much of this play as
please you and i charge you o men for the love
you bear to women as i perceive by your simpering
none of you hates them that between you and the
women the play may please if i were a woman i
would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
me complexions that liked me and breaths that i
defied not and i am sure as many as have good
beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my
kind offer when i make curtsy bid me farewell

under a compelling occasion let women die it were
pity to cast them away for nothing though between
them and a great cause they should be esteemed
nothing cleopatra catching but the least noise of
this dies instantly i have seen her die twenty
times upon far poorer moment i do think there is
mettle in death which commits some loving act upon
her she hath such a celerity in dying


mark antony

she is cunning past man thought
exit alexas


domitius enobarbus

alack sir no her passions are made of nothing but
the finest part of pure love we cannot call her
winds and waters sighs and tears they are greater
storms and tempests than almanacs can report this
cannot be cunning in her if it be she makes a
shower of rain as well as jove


mark antony

would i had never seen her


domitius enobarbus

o sir you had then left unseen a wonderful piece
of work which not to have been blest withal would
have discredited your travel

sir


mark antony

fulvia is dead


domitius enobarbus

fulvia


mark antony

dead


domitius enobarbus

why sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice when
it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
from him it shows to man the tailors of the earth
comforting therein that when old robes are worn
out there are members to make new if there were
no more women but fulvia then had you indeed a cut
and the case to be lamented this grief is crowned
with consolation your old smock brings forth a new
petticoat and indeed the tears live in an onion
that should water this sorrow


mark antony

the business she hath broached in the state
cannot endure my absence


domitius enobarbus

and the business you have broached here cannot be
without you especially that of cleopatra which
wholly depends on your abode


mark antony

no more light answers let our officers
have notice what we purpose i shall break
the cause of our expedience to the queen
and get her leave to part for not alone
the death of fulvia with more urgent touches
do strongly speak to us but the letters too
of many our contriving friends in rome
petition us at home sextus pompeius
hath given the dare to caesar and commands
the empire of the sea our slippery people
whose love is never link to the deserver
till his deserts are past begin to throw
pompey the great and all his dignities
upon his son who high in name and power
higher than both in blood and life stands up
for the main soldier whose quality going on
the sides o the world may danger much is breeding
which like the courser hair hath yet but life
and not a serpent poison say our pleasure
to such whose place is under us requires
our quick remove from hence

which break themselves in swearing


mark antony

most sweet queen 


cleopatra

nay pray you seek no colour for your going
but bid farewell and go when you sued staying
then was the time for words no going then
eternity was in our lips and eyes
bliss in our brows bent none our parts so poor
but was a race of heaven they are so still
or thou the greatest soldier of the world
art turn the greatest liar


mark antony

how now lady


cleopatra

i would i had thy inches thou shouldst know
there were a heart in egypt


mark antony

hear me queen
the strong necessity of time commands
our services awhile but my full heart
remains in use with you our italy
shines oer with civil swords sextus pompeius

equality of two domestic powers
breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength
are newly grown to love the condemn pompey
rich in his father honour creeps apace
into the hearts of such as have not thrived
upon the present state whose numbers threaten
and quietness grown sick of rest would purge
by any desperate change my more particular
and that which most with you should safe my going
is fulvia death


cleopatra

though age from folly could not give me freedom
it does from childishness can fulvia die


mark antony

she dead my queen
look here and at thy sovereign leisure read
the garboils she awaked at the last best
see when and where she died


cleopatra

o most false love
where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
with sorrowful water now i see i see
in fulvia death how mine received shall be


mark antony

quarrel no more but be prepared to know
the purposes i bear which are or cease
as you shall give the advice by the fire
that quickens nilus slime i go from hence

as thou affect


cleopatra

cut my lace charmian come
but let it be i am quickly ill and well
so antony loves


mark antony

my precious queen forbear
and give true evidence to his love which stands
an honourable trial


cleopatra

so fulvia told me
i prithee turn aside and weep for her
then bid adieu to me and say the tears
belong to egypt good now play one scene
of excellent dissembling and let it look

cleopatra

tis sweating labour
to bear such idleness so near the heart
as cleopatra this but sir forgive me
since my becomings kill me when they do not

therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly
and all the gods go with you upon your sword

scene iv rome octavius caesar house

enter octavius caesar reading a letter lepidus and their train


octavius caesar

you may see lepidus and henceforth know
it is not caesar natural vice to hate
our great competitor from alexandria
this is the news he fishes drinks and wastes
the lamps of night in revel is not more man-like
than cleopatra nor the queen of ptolemy
more womanly than he hardly gave audience or
vouchsafed to think he had partners you shall find there
a man who is the abstract of all faults
that all men follow


lepidus

i must not think there are
evils enow to darken all his goodness
his faults in him seem as the spots of heaven
more fiery by night blackness hereditary
rather than purchased what he cannot change
than what he chooses


octavius caesar

you are too indulgent let us grant it is not
amiss to tumble on the bed of ptolemy
to give a kingdom for a mirth to sit
and keep the turn of tippling with a slave
to reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet
with knaves that smell of sweat say this
becomes him 
as his composure must be rare indeed
whom these things cannot blemish yet must antony
no way excuse his soils when we do bear
so great weight in his lightness if he fill
his vacancy with his voluptuousness
full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
call on him fort but to confound such time
that drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
as his own state and ours tis to be chid
as we rate boys who being mature in knowledge
pawn their experience to their present pleasure
and so rebel to judgment

octavius caesar

i should have known no less
it hath been taught us from the primal state
that he which is was wish until he were
and the ebb man neer loved till neer worth love
comes dear by being lack this common body
like to a vagabond flag upon the stream

caesar i bring thee word
menecrates and menas famous pirates
make the sea serve them which they ear and wound
with keels of every kind many hot inroads
they make in italy the borders maritime

taken as seen for pompey name strikes more

antony
leave thy lascivious wassails when thou once
wast beaten from modena where thou slew
hirtius and pansa consuls at thy heel
did famine follow whom thou fought against
though daintily brought up with patience more
than savages could suffer thou didst drink
the stale of horses and the gilded puddle
which beasts would cough at thy palate then did deign
the roughest berry on the rudest hedge

when thou wast here above the ground i was

there would he anchor his aspect and die
with looking on his life

this orient pearl his speech sticks in my heart


cleopatra

mine ear must pluck it thence


alexas

good friend quoth he
ay the firm roman to great egypt sends
this treasure of an oyster at whose foot
to mend the petty present i will piece
her opulent throne with kingdoms all the east
say thou shall call her mistress so he nodded
and soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed
who neigh so high that what i would have spoke
was beastly dumb by him


cleopatra

what was he sad or merry


alexas

like to the time o the year between the extremes
of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merry


cleopatra

o well-divided disposition note him
note him good charmian tis the man but note him
he was not sad for he would shine on those
that make their looks by his he was not merry
which seem to tell them his remembrance lay
in egypt with his joy but between both
o heavenly mingle be thou sad or merry
the violence of either thee becomes
so does it no man else met thou my posts

pompey

whiles we are suitors to their throne decays
the thing we sue for


menecrates

we ignorant of ourselves
beg often our own harms which the wise powers
deny us for our good so find we profit
by losing of our prayers


pompey

i shall do well
the people love me and the sea is mine
my powers are crescent and my auguring hope
says it will come to the full mark antony
in egypt sits at dinner and will make
no wars without doors caesar gets money where
he loses hearts lepidus flatters both
of both is flatter but he neither loves
nor either cares for him


menas

caesar and lepidus
are in the field a mighty strength they carry


pompey

where have you this tis false


menas

pompey

he dreams i know they are in rome together
looking for antony but all the charms of love
salt cleopatra soften thy waned lip

sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite
that sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour

varrius

this is most certain that i shall deliver
mark antony is every hour in rome
expected since he went from egypt tis
a space for further travel


pompey

i could have given less matter
a better ear menas i did not think
this amorous surfeiter would have donn his helm
for such a petty war his soldiership
is twice the other twain but let us rear
the higher our opinion that our stirring
can from the lap of egypt widow pluck
the neer-lust-wearied antony


menas

i cannot hope
caesar and antony shall well greet together
his wife that dead did trespasses to caesar
his brother warr upon him although i think
not moved by antony


pompey

i know not menas
how lesser enmities may give way to greater
weret not that we stand up against them all
twere pregnant they should square between
themselves
for they have entertained cause enough
to draw their swords but how the fear of us
may cement their divisions and bind up
the petty difference we yet not know
bet as our gods will havet it only stands
our lives upon to use our strongest hands

domitius enobarbus

i shall entreat him
to answer like himself if caesar move him
let antony look over caesar head
and speak as loud as mars by jupiter
were i the wearer of antonius beard
i would not shavet to-day


lepidus

tis not a time
for private stomaching


domitius enobarbus

every time
serves for the matter that is then born int

mecaenas ask agrippa


lepidus

noble friends
that which combined us was most great and let not
a leaner action rend us what amiss
may it be gently heard when we debate
our trivial difference loud we do commit
murder in healing wounds then noble partners
the rather for i earnestly beseech
touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms
nor curstness grow to the matter


mark antony

tis spoken well
were we before our armies and to fight
i should do thus
flourish


octavius caesar

welcome to rome


mark antony

thank you


octavius caesar

sit


mark antony

sit sir


octavius caesar

nay then


mark antony

i learn you take things ill which are not so
or being concern you not


octavius caesar

i must be laugh at
if or for nothing or a little i
should say myself offended and with you
chiefly i the world more laugh at that i should
once name you derogately when to sound your name
it not concern me


mark antony

my being in egypt caesar
what wast to you


octavius caesar

no more than my residing here at rome
might be to you in egypt yet if you there
did practise on my state your being in egypt
might be my question


mark antony

how intend you practised


octavius caesar

you may be pleased to catch at mine intent
by what did here befal me your wife and brother
made wars upon me and their contestation
was theme for you you were the word of war


mark antony

you do mistake your business my brother never
did urge me in his act i did inquire it
and have my learning from some true reports
that drew their swords with you did he not rather
discredit my authority with yours
and make the wars alike against my stomach
having alike your cause of this my letters
before did satisfy you if youll patch a quarrel
as matter whole you have not to make it with
it must not be with this


octavius caesar

you praise yourself
by laying defects of judgment to me but
you patch up your excuses


mark antony

not so not so
i know you could not lack i am certain ont
very necessity of this thought that i
your partner in the cause gainst which he fought
could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
which fronted mine own peace as for my wife
i would you had her spirit in such another
the third o the world is yours which with a snaffle
you may pace easy but not such a wife


domitius enobarbus

would we had all such wives that the men might go
to wars with the women


mark antony

so much uncurbable her garboils caesar
made out of her impatience which not wanted
shrewdness of policy too i grieving grant
did you too much disquiet for that you must
but say i could not help it


octavius caesar

i wrote to you
when rioting in alexandria you
did pocket up my letters and with taunts
did gibe my missive out of audience


mark antony

sir
he fell upon me ere admitted then
three kings i had newly feasted and did want
of what i was i the morning but next day
i told him of myself which was as much
as to have ask him pardon let this fellow
be nothing of our strife if we contend
out of our question wipe him


octavius caesar

you have broken
the article of your oath which you shall never
have tongue to charge me with


lepidus

soft caesar


mark antony

no
lepidus let him speak
the honour is sacred which he talks on now
supposing that i lack it but on caesar
the article of my oath


octavius caesar

to lend me arms and aid when i required them
the which you both denied


mark antony

neglected rather
and then when poison hours had bound me up
from mine own knowledge as nearly as i may
ill play the penitent to you but mine honesty
shall not make poor my greatness nor my power
work without it truth is that fulvia
to have me out of egypt made wars here
for which myself the ignorant motive do
so far ask pardon as befits mine honour
to stoop in such a case


lepidus

tis noble spoken


mecaenas

if it might please you to enforce no further
the griefs between ye to forget them quite
were to remember that the present need
speaks to atone you


lepidus

worthily spoken mecaenas


domitius enobarbus

or if you borrow one another love for the
instant you may when you hear no more words of
pompey return it again you shall have time to
wrangle in when you have nothing else to do


mark antony

thou art a soldier only speak no more


domitius enobarbus

that truth should be silent i had almost forgot


mark antony

you wrong this presence therefore speak no more


domitius enobarbus

go to then your considerate stone


octavius caesar

i do not much dislike the matter but
the manner of his speech fort cannot be
we shall remain in friendship our conditions
so differing in their acts yet if i knew
what hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge
o the world i would pursue it


agrippa

give me leave caesar 


octavius caesar

speak agrippa


agrippa

thou hast a sister by the mother side
admired octavia great mark antony
is now a widower


octavius caesar

say not so agrippa
if cleopatra heard you your reproof
were well deserved of rashness


mark antony

i am not married caesar let me hear
agrippa further speak


agrippa

to hold you in perpetual amity
to make you brothers and to knit your hearts
with an unslipping  knot take antony
octavia to his wife whose beauty claims
no worse a husband than the best of men
whose virtue and whose general graces speak
that which none else can utter by this marriage
all little jealousies which now seem great
and all great fears which now import their dangers
would then be nothing truths would be tales
where now half tales be truths her love to both
would each to other and all loves to both
draw after her pardon what i have spoke
for tis a studied not a present thought
by duty ruminated


mark antony

will caesar speak


octavius caesar

not till he hears how antony is touch
with what is spoke already


mark antony

what power is in agrippa
if i would say agrippa be it so
to make this good


octavius caesar

the power of caesar and
his power unto octavia


mark antony

may i never
to this good purpose that so fairly shows
dream of impediment let me have thy hand
further this act of grace and from this hour
the heart of brothers govern in our loves
and sway our great designs


octavius caesar

there is my hand
a sister i bequeath you whom no brother
did ever love so dearly let her live
to join our kingdoms and our hearts and never
fly off our loves again


lepidus

happily amen


mark antony

i did not think to draw my sword gainst pompey
for he hath laid strange courtesies and great
of late upon me i must thank him only
lest my remembrance suffer ill report
at heel of that defy him


lepidus

time calls upon
of us must pompey presently be sought
or else he seeks out us


mark antony

where lies he


octavius caesar

about the mount misenum


mark antony

what is his strength by land


octavius caesar

great and increasing but by sea
he is an absolute master


mark antony

so is the fame
would we had spoke together haste we for it
yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we
the business we have talk of


octavius caesar

with most gladness
and do invite you to my sister view
whither straight ill lead you

welcome from egypt sir

honourable friend agrippa


agrippa

good enobarbus


mecaenas

we have cause to be glad that matters are so well
digested you stayed well by t in egypt


domitius enobarbus

ay sir we did sleep day out of countenance and
made the night light with drinking


mecaenas

eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast and
but twelve persons there is this true


domitius enobarbus

this was but as a fly by an eagle we had much more
monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved noting


mecaenas

she a most triumphant lady if report be square to
her


domitius enobarbus

when she first met mark antony she pursed up
his heart upon the river of cydnus


agrippa

there she appeared indeed or my reporter devised
well for her


domitius enobarbus

i will tell you
the barge she sat in like a burnish throne
burn on the water the poop was beaten gold
purple the sails and so perfumed that
the winds were love-sick with them the oars were silver
which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made
the water which they beat to follow faster
as amorous of their strokes for her own person
it beggar all description she did lie
in her pavilion cloth-of-gold of tissue 
oer-picturing that venus where we see
the fancy outwork nature on each side her
stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling cupids
with divers-colour fans whose wind did seem
to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool
and what they undid did


agrippa

o rare for antony


domitius enobarbus

her gentlewomen like the nereides
so many mermaids tended her i the eyes
and made their bends adornings at the helm
a seeming mermaid steers the silken tackle
swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands
that yarely frame the office from the barge
a strange invisible perfume hits the sense
of the adjacent wharfs the city cast
her people out upon her and antony
enthroned i the market-place did sit alone
whistling to the air which but for vacancy
had gone to gaze on cleopatra too
and made a gap in nature


agrippa

rare egyptian


domitius enobarbus

upon her landing antony sent to her
invited her to supper she replied
it should be better he became her guest
which she entreated our courteous antony
whom neer the word of no woman heard speak
being barber ten times oer goes to the feast
and for his ordinary pays his heart
for what his eyes eat only


agrippa

royal wench
she made great caesar lay his sword to bed
he plough her and she cropp


domitius enobarbus

i saw her once
hop forty paces through the public street
and having lost her breath she spoke and panted
that she did make defect perfection
and breathless power breathe forth


mecaenas

now antony must leave her utterly


domitius enobarbus

never he will not
age cannot wither her nor custom stale
her infinite variety other women cloy
the appetites they feed but she makes hungry
where most she satisfies for vilest things
become themselves in her that the holy priests
bless her when she is riggish


mecaenas

if beauty wisdom modesty can settle
the heart of antony octavia is
a blessed lottery to him


agrippa

let us go
good enobarbus make yourself my guest
whilst you abide here

to you all three
the senators alone of this great world
chief factors for the gods i do not know
wherefore my father should revengers want
having a son and friends since julius caesar
who at philippi the good brutus ghosted
there saw you labouring for him what wast
that moved pale cassius to conspire and what
made the all-honour honest roman brutus
with the arm rest courtiers and beauteous freedom
to drench the capitol but that they would
have one man but a man and that is it
hath made me rig my navy at whose burthen
the anger ocean foams with which i meant
to scourge the ingratitude that despiteful rome
cast on my noble father

domitius enobarbus

four feasts are toward


pompey

let me shake thy hand
i never hated thee i have seen thee fight
when i have envied thy behavior


domitius enobarbus

sir
i never loved you much but i ha praised ye
when you have well deserved ten times as much
as i have said you did


pompey

aboard my galley i invite you all
will you lead lords


octavius caesar

mark antony

lepidus

pompey

menas

aside  thy father pompey would neer have
made this treaty you and i have known sir


domitius enobarbus

at sea i think


menas

we have sir


domitius enobarbus

you have done well by water


menas

and you by land


domitius enobarbus

i will praise any man that will praise me though it
cannot be denied what i have done by land


menas

nor what i have done by water


domitius enobarbus

yes something you can deny for your own
safety you have been a great thief by sea


menas

and you by land


domitius enobarbus

there i deny my land service but give me your
hand menas if our eyes had authority here they
might take two thieves kissing


menas

all men faces are true whatsomeer their hands are


domitius enobarbus

but there is never a fair woman has a true face


menas

no slander they steal hearts


domitius enobarbus

we came hither to fight with you


menas

for my part i am sorry it is turned to a drinking
pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune


domitius enobarbus

if he do sure he cannot weept back again


menas

youve said sir we looked not for mark antony
here pray you is he married to cleopatra


domitius enobarbus

caesar sister is called octavia


menas

true sir she was the wife of caius marcellus


domitius enobarbus

but she is now the wife of marcus antonius


menas

pray ye sir


domitius enobarbus

tis true


menas

then is caesar and he for ever knit together


domitius enobarbus

if i were bound to divine of this unity i would
not prophesy so


menas

i think the policy of that purpose made more in the
marriage than the love of the parties


domitius enobarbus

i think so too but you shall find the band that
seems to tie their friendship together will be the
very strangler of their amity octavia is of a
holy cold and still conversation


menas

who would not have his wife so


domitius enobarbus

not he that himself is not so which is mark antony
he will to his egyptian dish again then shall the
sighs of octavia blow the fire up in caesar and as
i said before that which is the strength of their
amity shall prove the immediate author of their
variance antony will use his affection where it is
he married but his occasion here


menas

and thus it may be come sir will you aboard
i have a health for you


domitius enobarbus

i shall take it sir we have used our throats in egypt


menas

before our army thy pacorus orodes

noble ventidius
whilst yet with parthian blood thy sword is warm
the fugitive parthians follow spur through media
mesopotamia and the shelters whither
the routed fly so thy grand captain antony
shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
put garlands on thy head


ventidius

o silius silius
i have done enough a lower place note well
may make too great an act for learn this silius
better to leave undone than by our deed
acquire too high a fame when him we serve away
caesar and antony have ever won
more in their officer than person sossius
one of my place in syria his lieutenant
for quick accumulation of renown
which he achieved by the minute lost his favour
who does i the wars more than his captain can
becomes his captain captain and ambition
the soldier virtue rather makes choice of loss
than gain which darkens him
i could do more to do antonius good
but twould offend him and in his offence
should my performance perish


silius

thou hast ventidius
that
without the which a soldier and his sword
grants scarce distinction thou wilt write to antony


ventidius

ill humbly signify what in his name
that magical word of war we have effected
how with his banners and his well-paid ranks
the neer-yet-beaten horse of parthia
we have jaded out o the field


silius

where is he now

he purposeth to athens whither with what haste
the weight we must convey with will permit
we shall appear before him on there pass along

raised by your populous troops but you are come
a market-maid to rome and have prevented
the ostentation of our love which left unshown
is often left unloved we should have met you
by sea and land supplying every stage
with an augmented greeting

and ever welcome to us

thou hast forspoke my being in these wars
and say it is not fit


domitius enobarbus

well is it is it


cleopatra

if not denounced against us why should not we
be there in person


domitius enobarbus

aside  well i could reply
if we should serve with horse and mares together
the horse were merely lost the mares would bear
a soldier and his horse


cleopatra

what ist you say


domitius enobarbus

your presence needs must puzzle antony
take from his heart take from his brain
from time
what should not then be spared he is already
traduced for levity and tis said in rome
that photinus an eunuch and your maids
manage this war


cleopatra

sink rome and their tongues rot
that speak against us a charge we bear i the war
and as the president of my kingdom will
appear there for a man speak not against it
i will not stay behind

nay i have done
here comes the emperor
enter mark antony and canidius

is it not strange canidius
that from tarentum and brundusium
he could so quickly cut the ionian sea
and take in toryne you have heard ont sweet

celerity is never more admired
than by the negligent


mark antony

a good rebuke
which might have well becomed the best of men
to taunt at slackness canidius we
will fight with him by sea


cleopatra

by sea what else


canidius

why will my lord do so


mark antony

for that he dares us tot


domitius enobarbus

so hath my lord dared him to single fight


canidius

ay and to wage this battle at pharsalia
where caesar fought with pompey but these offers
which serve not for his vantage be shakes off
and so should you


domitius enobarbus

your ships are not well mann
your mariners are muleters reapers people
ingross by swift impress in caesar fleet
are those that often have gainst pompey fought
their ships are yare yours heavy no disgrace
shall fall you for refusing him at sea
being prepared for land


mark antony

by sea by sea


domitius enobarbus

most worthy sir you therein throw away
the absolute soldiership you have by land
distract your army which doth most consist
of war-mark footmen leave unexecuted
your own renowned knowledge quite forego
the way which promises assurance and
give up yourself merely to chance and hazard
from firm security


mark antony

ill fight at sea


cleopatra

i have sixty sails caesar none better


mark antony

requires to live in egypt which not granted
he lessens his requests and to thee sues

submits her to thy might and of thee craves

antony only that would make his will
lord of his reason what though you fled
from that great face of war whose several ranges
frighted each other why should he follow
the itch of his affection should not then
have nick his captainship at such a point
when half to half the world opposed he being

than was his loss to course your flying flags
and leave his navy gazing

or needs not us if caesar please our master

thus then thou most renown caesar entreats
not to consider in what case thou stand
further than he is caesar

go on right royal

he knows that you embrace not antony
as you did love but as you fear him

does pity as constrained blemishes
not as deserved

he is a god and knows
what is most right mine honour was not yielded
but conquer merely

i will ask antony sir sir thou art so leaky
that we must leave thee to thy sinking for
thy dearest quit thee
exit


thyreus

shall i say to caesar
what you require of him for he partly begs
to be desired to give it much would please him

you have been a boggler ever

o misery ont the wise gods seel our eyes
in our own filth drop our clear judgments make us
adore our errors laugh at while we strut

cleopatra

o ist come to this


mark antony

i found you as a morsel cold upon
dead caesar trencher nay you were a fragment
of cneius pompey besides what hotter hours
unregister in vulgar fame you have
luxuriously pick out for i am sure
though you can guess what temperance should be
you know not what it is


cleopatra

wherefore is this


mark antony

to let a fellow that will take rewards
and say god quit you be familiar with
my playfellow your hand this kingly seal
and plighter of high hearts o that i were

first attendant

he did ask favour

if that thy father live let him repent
thou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorry
to follow caesar in his triumph since
thou hast been whipp for following him henceforth
the white hand of a lady fever thee
shake thou to look on t get thee back to caesar
tell him thy entertainment look thou say
he makes me angry with him for he seems
proud and disdainful harping on what i am
not what he knew i was he makes me angry
and at this time most easy tis to dot
when my good stars that were my former guides
have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
into the abysm of hell if he mislike
my speech and what is done tell him he has
hipparchus my enfranched bondman whom
he may at pleasure whip or hang or torture
as he shall like to quit me urge it thou
hence with thy stripes begone

cleopatra

have you done yet


mark antony

alack our terrene moon
is now eclipsed and it portends alone

mark antony

to flatter caesar would you mingle eyes
with one that ties his points


cleopatra

not know me yet


mark antony

cold-hearted toward me


cleopatra

ah dear if i be so
from my cold heart let heaven engender hail
and poison it in the source and the first stone
drop in my neck as it determines so
dissolve my life the next caesarion smite
till by degrees the memory of my womb
together with my brave egyptians all
by the discandying of this pelleted storm
lie graveless till the flies and gnats of nile
have buried them for prey


mark antony

i am satisfied
caesar sits down in alexandria where
i will oppose his fate our force by land
hath nobly held our sever navy too
have knit again and fleet threatening most sea-like
where hast thou been my heart dost thou hear lady
if from the field i shall return once more
to kiss these lips i will appear in blood
i and my sword will earn our chronicle
there hope int yet


cleopatra

that my brave lord


mark antony

i will be treble-sinew hearted breathed
and fight maliciously for when mine hours
were nice and lucky men did ransom lives
of me for jests but now ill set my teeth
and send to darkness all that stop me come
let have one other gaudy night call to me
all my sad captains fill our bowls once more
let mock the midnight bell


cleopatra

it is my birth-day
i had thought to have held it poor but since my lord
is antony again i will be cleopatra


mark antony

we will yet do well


cleopatra

call all his noble captains to my lord

do so well speak to them and to-night ill force
the wine peep through their scars come on my queen
there sap int yet the next time i do fight
ill make death love me for i will contend
even with his pestilent scythe
exeunt all but domitius enobarbus


domitius enobarbus

now hell outstare the lightning to be furious
is to be frighted out of fear and in that mood

restores his heart when valour preys on reason
it eats the sword it fights with i will seek
some way to leave him

to throw my sceptre at the injurious gods
to tell them that this world did equal theirs
till they had stoln our jewel all but naught

a moiety of the world

with his most noble blood


octavius caesar

look you sad friends

agrippa

a rarer spirit never
did steer humanity but you gods will give us
some faults to make us men caesar is touch

that thou my brother my competitor
in top of all design my mate in empire

cleopatra

i dream there was an emperor antony
o such another sleep that i might see
but such another man


dolabella

if it might please ye 


cleopatra

his face was as the heavens and therein stuck
a sun and moon which kept their course
and lighted
the little o the earth


dolabella

most sovereign creature 


cleopatra

his legs bestrid the ocean his rear arm
crested the world his voice was propertied
as all the tuned spheres and that to friends
but when he meant to quail and shake the orb
he was as rattling thunder for his bounty
there was no winter int an autumn twas
that grew the more by reaping his delights
were dolphin-like they show his back above
the element they lived in in his livery
walk crowns and crownets realms and islands were
as plates dropp from his pocket


dolabella

cleopatra


cleopatra

think you there was or might be such a man
as this i dream of


dolabella

gentle madam no


cleopatra

you lie up to the hearing of the gods
but if there be or ever were one such
it past the size of dreaming nature wants stuff
to vie strange forms with fancy yet to imagine
and antony were nature piece gainst fancy
condemning shadows quite


dolabella

hear me good madam
your loss is as yourself great and you bear it
as answering to the weight would i might never
oertake pursued success but i do feel
by the rebound of yours a grief that smites
my very heart at root


cleopatra

i thank you sir
know you what caesar means to do with me


dolabella

i am loath to tell you what i would you knew

cleopatra

sole sir o the world
i cannot project mine own cause so well
to make it clear but do confess i have
been laden with like frailties which before
have often shamed our sex


octavius caesar

cleopatra know
we will extenuate rather than enforce
if you apply yourself to our intents
which towards you are most gentle you shall find
a benefit in this change but if you seek
to lay on me a cruelty by taking
antony course you shall bereave yourself
of my good purposes and put your children
to that destruction which ill guard them from
if thereon you rely ill take my leave


cleopatra

o caesar what a wounding shame is this
that thou vouchsafing here to visit me

parcel the sum of my disgraces by
addition of his envy say good caesar
that i some lady trifles have reserved
immoment toys things of such dignity
as we greet modern friends withal and say
some nobler token i have kept apart
for livia and octavia to induce
their mediation must i be unfolded
with one that i have bred the gods it smites me
beneath the fall i have
to seleucus
prithee go hence
or i shall show the cinders of my spirits
through the ashes of my chance wert thou a man
thou wouldst have mercy on me


octavius caesar

forbear seleucus
exit seleucus


cleopatra

for things that others do and when we fall

clown

that should desire you to touch him for his biting
is immortal those that do die of it do seldom or
never recover


cleopatra

rememberest thou any that have died ont


clown

very many men and women too i heard of one of
them no longer than yesterday a very honest woman
but something given to lie as a woman should not
do but in the way of honesty how she died of the
biting of it what pain she felt truly she makes
a very good report o the worm but he that will
believe all that they say shall never be saved by
half that they do but this is most fallible the
worm an odd worm


cleopatra

get thee hence farewell

setting down his basket


cleopatra

farewell


clown

do his kind

keeping of wise people for indeed there is no
goodness in worm

not worth the feeding


cleopatra

clown

you must not think i am so simple but i know the
devil himself will not eat a woman i know that a
woman is a dish for the gods if the devil dress her
not but truly these same whoreson devils do the
gods great harm in their women for in every ten
that they make the devils mar five


cleopatra

well get thee gone farewell

come then and take the last warmth of my lips
farewell kind charmian iras long farewell
kisses them iras falls and dies

the stroke of death is as a lover pinch
which hurts and is desired dost thou lie still
if thus thou vanishest thou tell the world
it is not worth leave-taking


charmian

dissolve thick cloud and rain that i may say
the gods themselves do weep


cleopatra

this proves me base
if she first meet the curled antony
hell make demand of her and spend that kiss
which is my heaven to have come thou
mortal wretch
to an asp which she applies to her breast
with thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
of life at once untie poor venomous fool
be angry and dispatch o couldst thou speak
that i might hear thee call great caesar ass
unpolicied

i do not see them bleed


dolabella

who was last with them


first guard

a simple countryman that brought her figs
this was his basket


octavius caesar

poison then


first guard

o caesar
this charmian lived but now she stood and spake
i found her trimming up the diadem
on her dead mistress tremblingly she stood
and on the sudden dropp


octavius caesar

o noble weakness
if they had swallow poison twould appear
by external swelling but she looks like sleep
as she would catch another antony
in her strong toil of grace


dolabella

here on her breast
there is a vent of blood and something blown
the like is on her arm


first guard

this is an aspic trail and these fig-leaves
have slime upon them such as the aspic leaves
upon the caves of nile


octavius caesar

most probable
that so she died for her physician tells me
she hath pursued conclusions infinite
of easy ways to die take up her bed
and bear her women from the monument
she shall be buried by her antony
no grave upon the earth shall clip in it
a pair so famous high events as these
strike those that make them and their story is
no less in pity than his glory which
brought them to be lamented our army shall
in solemn show attend this funeral
and then to rome come dolabella see

act i
scene i a hall in duke solinus palace

enter duke solinus aegeon gaoler officers and other attendants


aegeon

proceed solinus to procure my fall
and by the doom of death end woes and all


duke solinus

merchant of syracuse plead no more
i am not partial to infringe our laws
the enmity and discord which of late
sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
to merchants our well-dealing countrymen
who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
have seal his rigorous statutes with their bloods
excludes all pity from our threatening looks
for since the mortal and intestine jars
twixt thy seditious countrymen and us
it hath in solemn synods been decreed
both by the syracusians and ourselves
to admit no traffic to our adverse towns nay more
if any born at ephesus be seen
at any syracusian marts and fairs
again if any syracusian born
come to the bay of ephesus he dies
his goods confiscate to the duke dispose
unless a thousand marks be levied
to quit the penalty and to ransom him
thy substance valued at the highest rate
cannot amount unto a hundred marks
therefore by law thou art condemned to die


aegeon

yet this my comfort when your words are done
my woes end likewise with the evening sun


duke solinus

well syracusian say in brief the cause
why thou departed from thy native home
and for what cause thou camest to ephesus


aegeon

a heavier task could not have been imposed
than i to speak my griefs unspeakable
yet that the world may witness that my end
was wrought by nature not by vile offence
ill utter what my sorrows give me leave
in syracusa was i born and wed
unto a woman happy but for me
and by me had not our hap been bad
with her i lived in joy our wealth increased
by prosperous voyages i often made
to epidamnum till my factor death
and the great care of goods at random left
drew me from kind embracements of my spouse
from whom my absence was not six months old
before herself almost at fainting under
the pleasing punishment that women bear
had made provision for her following me
and soon and safe arrived where i was
there had she not been long but she became
a joyful mother of two goodly sons
and which was strange the one so like the other
as could not be distinguish but by names
that very hour and in the self-same inn
a meaner woman was delivered
of such a burden male twins both alike
those for their parents were exceeding poor 
i bought and brought up to attend my sons
my wife not meanly proud of two such boys
made daily motions for our home return
unwilling i agreed alas too soon
we came aboard
a league from epidamnum had we sail
before the always wind-obeying deep
gave any tragic instance of our harm
but longer did we not retain much hope
for what obscured light the heavens did grant
did but convey unto our fearful minds
a doubtful warrant of immediate death
which though myself would gladly have embraced
yet the incessant weepings of my wife
weeping before for what she saw must come
and piteous plainings of the pretty babes
that mourn for fashion ignorant what to fear
forced me to seek delays for them and me
and this it was for other means was none
the sailors sought for safety by our boat
and left the ship then sinking-ripe to us
my wife more careful for the latter-born
had fasten him unto a small spare mast
such as seafaring men provide for storms
to him one of the other twins was bound
whilst i had been like heedful of the other
the children thus disposed my wife and i
fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix
fasten ourselves at either end the mast
and floating straight obedient to the stream
was carried towards corinth as we thought
at length the sun gazing upon the earth
dispersed those vapours that offended us
and by the benefit of his wished light
the seas wax calm and we discovered
two ships from far making amain to us
of corinth that of epidaurus this
but ere they came o let me say no more
gather the sequel by that went before


duke solinus

nay forward old man do not break off so
for we may pity though not pardon thee


aegeon

o had the gods done so i had not now
worthily term them merciless to us
for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues
we were encounterd by a mighty rock
which being violently borne upon
our helpful ship was splitted in the midst
so that in this unjust divorce of us
fortune had left to both of us alike
what to delight in what to sorrow for
her part poor soul seeming as burdened
with lesser weight but not with lesser woe
was carried with more speed before the wind
and in our sight they three were taken up
by fishermen of corinth as we thought
at length another ship had seized on us
and knowing whom it was their hap to save
gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck guests
and would have reft the fishers of their prey
had not their bark been very slow of sail
and therefore homeward did they bend their course
thus have you heard me sever from my bliss
that by misfortunes was my life prolong
to tell sad stories of my own mishaps


duke solinus

and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for
do me the favour to dilate at full
what hath befalln of them and thee till now


aegeon

my youngest boy and yet my eldest care
at eighteen years became inquisitive
after his brother and importuned me
that his attendant so his case was like
reft of his brother but retain his name 
might bear him company in the quest of him
whom whilst i labour of a love to see
i hazarded the loss of whom i loved
five summers have i spent in furthest greece
roaming clean through the bounds of asia
and coasting homeward came to ephesus
hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought
or that or any place that harbours men
but here must end the story of my life
and happy were i in my timely death
could all my travels warrant me they live


duke solinus

hapless aegeon whom the fates have mark
to bear the extremity of dire mishap
now trust me were it not against our laws
against my crown my oath my dignity
which princes would they may not disannul
my soul would sue as advocate for thee
but though thou art adjudged to the death
and passed sentence may not be recall
but to our honour great disparagement
yet i will favour thee in what i can
therefore merchant ill limit thee this day
to seek thy life by beneficial help
try all the friends thou hast in ephesus
beg thou or borrow to make up the sum
and live if no then thou art doom to die
gaoler take him to thy custody


gaoler

i will my lord


aegeon

hopeless and helpless doth aegeon wend
but to procrastinate his lifeless end

dark-working sorcerers that change the mind
soul-killing witches that deform the body
disguised cheaters prating mountebanks

perhaps some merchant hath invited him
and from the mart he somewhere gone to dinner
good sister let us dine and never fret
a man is master of his liberty
time is their master and when they see time
theyll go or come if so be patient sister


adriana

why should their liberty than ours be more


luciana

because their business still lies out o door


adriana

look when i serve him so he takes it ill


luciana

o know he is the bridle of your will


adriana

there none but asses will be bridled so


luciana

why headstrong liberty is lash with woe
there nothing situate under heaven eye
but hath his bound in earth in sea in sky
the beasts the fishes and the winged fowls
are their males subjects and at their controls
men more divine the masters of all these
lords of the wide world and wild watery seas
indued with intellectual sense and souls
of more preeminence than fish and fowls
are masters to their females and their lords
then let your will attend on their accords


adriana

this servitude makes you to keep unwed


luciana

not this but troubles of the marriage-bed


adriana

but were you wedded you would bear some sway


luciana

ere i learn love ill practise to obey


adriana

how if your husband start some other where


luciana

till he come home again i would forbear


adriana

patience unmoved no marvel though she pause
they can be meek that have no other cause
a wretched soul bruised with adversity
we bid be quiet when we hear it cry
but were we burdened with like weight of pain
as much or more would we ourselves complain
so thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee
with urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me
but if thou live to see like right bereft
this fool-begg patience in thee will be left


luciana

well i will marry one day but to try
here comes your man now is your husband nigh
enter dromio of ephesus

dromio of ephesus

ay ay he told his mind upon mine ear
beshrew his hand i scarce could understand it


luciana

spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning


dromio of ephesus

nay he struck so plainly i could too well feel his
blows and withal so doubtfully that i could scarce
understand them


adriana

but say i prithee is he coming home it seems he
hath great care to please his wife


dromio of ephesus

when i desired him to come home to dinner

if i last in this service you must case me in leather
exit


luciana

fie how impatience loureth in your face


adriana

his company must do his minions grace
whilst i at home starve for a merry look
hath homely age the alluring beauty took
from my poor cheek then he hath wasted it
are my discourses dull barren my wit
if voluble and sharp discourse be marr
unkindness blunts it more than marble hard
do their gay vestments his affections bait
that not my fault he master of my state
what ruins are in me that can be found
by him not ruin then is he the ground
of my defeatures my decayed fair
a sunny look of his would soon repair
but too unruly deer he breaks the pale
and feeds from home poor i am but his stale


luciana

self-harming jealousy fie beat it hence


adriana

unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense
i know his eye doth homage otherwhere
or else what lets it but he would be here
sister you know he promised me a chain
would that alone alone he would detain
so he would keep fair quarter with his bed
i see the jewel best enamelled
will lose his beauty yet the gold bides still
that others touch and often touching will
wear gold and no man that hath a name
by falsehood and corruption doth it shame
since that my beauty cannot please his eye
ill weep what left away and weeping die

and fashion your demeanor to my looks
or i will beat this method in your sconce


dromio of syracuse

well sir then twill be dry


dromio of syracuse

if it be sir i pray you eat none of it
antipholus


of syracuse

your reason


dromio of syracuse

lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
dry basting
antipholus


of syracuse

well sir learn to jest in good time there a
time for all things


dromio of syracuse

i durst have denied that before you were so choleric
antipholus


of syracuse

by what rule sir


dromio of syracuse

marry sir by a rule as plain as the plain bald
pate of father time himself
antipholus


of syracuse

let hear it


dromio of syracuse

there no time for a man to recover his hair that
grows bald by nature
antipholus


of syracuse

may he not do it by fine and recovery


dromio of syracuse

yes to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
lost hair of another man
antipholus


of syracuse

why is time such a niggard of hair being as it is
so plentiful an excrement


dromio of syracuse

because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts
and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit
antipholus


of syracuse

why but there many a man hath more hair than wit


dromio of syracuse

not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair
antipholus


of syracuse

why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit


dromio of syracuse

the plainer dealer the sooner lost yet he loseth
it in a kind of jollity
antipholus


of syracuse

for what reason


dromio of syracuse

for two and sound ones too
antipholus


of syracuse

nay not sound i pray you


dromio of syracuse

sure ones then
antipholus


of syracuse

nay not sure in a thing falsing


dromio of syracuse

certain ones then
antipholus


of syracuse

name them


dromio of syracuse

the one to save the money that he spends in
trimming the other that at dinner they should not
drop in his porridge
antipholus


of syracuse

you would all this time have proved there is no
time for all things


dromio of syracuse

marry and did sir namely no time to recover hair
lost by nature
antipholus


of syracuse

but your reason was not substantial why there is no
time to recover


dromio of syracuse

thus i mend it time himself is bald and therefore
to the world end will have bald followers
antipholus


of syracuse

i knew twould be a bald conclusion
but soft who wafts us yonder
enter adriana and luciana


adriana

ay ay antipholus look strange and frown
some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects
i am not adriana nor thy wife
the time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
that never words were music to thine ear
that never object pleasing in thine eye
that never touch well welcome to thy hand
that never meat sweet-savor in thy taste
unless i spake or look or touch or carved to thee
how comes it now my husband o how comes it
that thou art thus estranged from thyself
thyself i call it being strange to me
that undividable incorporate
am better than thy dear self better part
ah do not tear away thyself from me
for know my love as easy mayest thou fall
a drop of water in the breaking gulf
and take unmingled that same drop again
without addition or diminishing
as take from me thyself and not me too
how dearly would it touch me to the quick
shouldst thou but hear i were licentious
and that this body consecrate to thee
by ruffian lust should be contaminate
wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
and hurl the name of husband in my face
and tear the stain skin off my harlot-brow
and from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
and break it with a deep-divorcing vow
i know thou canst and therefore see thou do it
i am possess with an adulterate blot
my blood is mingled with the crime of lust
for if we too be one and thou play false
i do digest the poison of thy flesh
being strumpeted by thy contagion
keep then far league and truce with thy true bed
i live unstain thou undishonoured
antipholus


of syracuse

plead you to me fair dame i know you not
in ephesus i am but two hours old
as strange unto your town as to your talk
who every word by all my wit being scann
want wit in all one word to understand


luciana

fie brother how the world is changed with you
when were you wont to use my sister thus
she sent for you by dromio home to dinner
antipholus


of syracuse

by dromio


dromio of syracuse

by me


adriana

by thee and this thou didst return from him
that he did buffet thee and in his blows
denied my house for his me for his wife
antipholus


of syracuse

did you converse sir with this gentlewoman
what is the course and drift of your compact


dromio of syracuse

i sir i never saw her till this time
antipholus


of syracuse

villain thou liest for even her very words
didst thou deliver to me on the mart


dromio of syracuse

i never spake with her in all my life
antipholus


of syracuse

how can she thus then call us by our names
unless it be by inspiration


adriana

how ill agrees it with your gravity
to counterfeit thus grossly with your slave
abetting him to thwart me in my mood
be it my wrong you are from me exempt
but wrong not that wrong with a more contempt
come i will fasten on this sleeve of thine
thou art an elm my husband i a vine
whose weakness married to thy stronger state
makes me with thy strength to communicate
if aught possess thee from me it is dross
usurping ivy brier or idle moss
who all for want of pruning with intrusion
infect thy sap and live on thy confusion
antipholus


of syracuse

to me she speaks she moves me for her theme
what was i married to her in my dream
or sleep i now and think i hear all this
what error drives our eyes and ears amiss
until i know this sure uncertainty
ill entertain the offer fallacy


luciana

dromio go bid the servants spread for dinner


dromio of syracuse

o for my beads i cross me for a sinner
this is the fairy land o spite of spites
we talk with goblins owls and sprites
if we obey them not this will ensue
theyll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue


luciana

why pratest thou to thyself and answer not
dromio thou drone thou snail thou slug thou sot


dromio of syracuse

i am transformed master am i not
antipholus


of syracuse

i think thou art in mind and so am i


dromio of syracuse

nay master both in mind and in my shape
antipholus


of syracuse

thou hast thine own form


dromio of syracuse

no i am an ape


luciana

if thou art changed to aught tis to an ass


dromio of syracuse

tis true she rides me and i long for grass
tis so i am an ass else it could never be
but i should know her as well as she knows me


adriana

come come no longer will i be a fool
to put the finger in the eye and weep
whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn
come sir to dinner dromio keep the gate
husband ill dine above with you to-day
and shrive you of a thousand idle pranks
sirrah if any ask you for your master
say he dines forth and let no creature enter
come sister dromio play the porter well
antipholus


of syracuse

am i in earth in heaven or in hell
sleeping or waking mad or well-advised
known unto these and to myself disguised
ill say as they say and persever so
and in this mist at all adventures go


dromio of syracuse

master shall i be porter at the gate


adriana

ay and let none enter lest i break your pate


luciana

balthazar

have patience sir o let it not be so
herein you war against your reputation
and draw within the compass of suspect
the unviolated honour of your wife
once this your long experience of her wisdom
her sober virtue years and modesty
plead on her part some cause to you unknown
and doubt not sir but she will well excuse
why at this time the doors are made against you
be ruled by me depart in patience
and let us to the tiger all to dinner
and about evening come yourself alone
to know the reason of this strange restraint
if by strong hand you offer to break in
now in the stirring passage of the day
a vulgar comment will be made of it
and that supposed by the common rout
against your yet ungalled estimation
that may with foul intrusion enter in
and dwell upon your grave when you are dead
for slander lives upon succession
for ever housed where it gets possession
antipholus


of ephesus

you have prevailed i will depart in quiet
and in despite of mirth mean to be merry
i know a wench of excellent discourse
pretty and witty wild and yet too gentle
there will we dine this woman that i mean
my wife but i protest without desert 
hath oftentimes upbraided me withal
to her will we to dinner
to angelo
get you home
and fetch the chain by this i know tis made
bring it i pray you to the porpentine
for there the house that chain will i bestow 
be it for nothing but to spite my wife 
upon mine hostess there good sir make haste
since mine own doors refuse to entertain me
ill knock elsewhere to see if theyll disdain me


angelo

ill meet you at that place some hour hence
antipholus


of ephesus

do so this jest shall cost me some expense
exeunt

scene ii the same

enter luciana and antipholus of syracuse


luciana

and may it be that you have quite forgot
a husband office shall antipholus
even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot
shall love in building grow so ruinous
if you did wed my sister for her wealth
then for her wealth sake use her with more kindness
or if you like elsewhere do it by stealth
muffle your false love with some show of blindness
let not my sister read it in your eye
be not thy tongue thy own shame orator
look sweet be fair become disloyalty
apparel vice like virtue harbinger
bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted
teach sin the carriage of a holy saint
be secret-false what need she be acquainted
what simple thief brags of his own attaint
tis double wrong to truant with your bed
and let her read it in thy looks at board
shame hath a bastard fame well managed
ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word
alas poor women make us but believe
being compact of credit that you love us
though others have the arm show us the sleeve
we in your motion turn and you may move us
then gentle brother get you in again
comfort my sister cheer her call her wife
tis holy sport to be a little vain
when the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife
antipholus


of syracuse

sweet mistress what your name is else i know not
nor by what wonder you do hit of mine 
less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
than our earth wonder more than earth divine
teach me dear creature how to think and speak
lay open to my earthy-gross conceit
smother in errors feeble shallow weak
the folded meaning of your words deceit
against my soul pure truth why labour you
to make it wander in an unknown field
are you a god would you create me new
transform me then and to your power ill yield
but if that i am i then well i know
your weeping sister is no wife of mine
nor to her bed no homage do i owe
far more far more to you do i decline
o train me not sweet mermaid with thy note
to drown me in thy sister flood of tears
sing siren for thyself and i will dote
spread oer the silver waves thy golden hairs
and as a bed ill take them and there lie
and in that glorious supposition think
he gains by death that hath such means to die
let love being light be drowned if she sink


luciana

what are you mad that you do reason so
antipholus


of syracuse

not mad but mated how i do not know


luciana

it is a fault that springeth from your eye
antipholus


of syracuse

for gazing on your beams fair sun being by


luciana

adriana

what observation madest thou in this case
of his heart meteors tilting in his face


luciana

first he denied you had in him no right


adriana

he meant he did me none the more my spite


luciana

then swore he that he was a stranger here

luciana

adriana

i cannot nor i will not hold me still
my tongue though not my heart shall have his will

luciana

one whose hard heart is button up with steel
a fiend a fury pitiless and rough
a wolf nay worse a fellow all in buff
a back-friend a shoulder-clapper one that
countermands
the passages of alleys creeks and narrow lands
a hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well
one that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell


adriana

dromio of syracuse

men and gives them suits of durance he that sets up

courtezan

now out of doubt antipholus is mad
else would he never so demean himself
a ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats
and for the same he promised me a chain
both one and other he denies me now
the reason that i gather he is mad
besides this present instance of his rage
is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner
of his own doors being shut against his entrance
belike his wife acquainted with his fits
on purpose shut the doors against his way
my way is now to hie home to his house
and tell his wife that being lunatic
he rush into my house and took perforce
my ring away this course i fittest choose
for forty ducats is too much to lose

though most dishonestly he doth deny it


second merchant

how is the man esteemed here in the city


angelo

of very reverend reputation sir
of credit infinite highly beloved
second to none that lives here in the city
his word might bear my wealth at any time


second merchant

speak softly yonder as i think he walks
enter antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse


angelo

tis so and that self chain about his neck
which he forswore most monstrously to have
good sir draw near to me ill speak to him
signior antipholus i wonder much
that you would put me to this shame and trouble
and not without some scandal to yourself
with circumstance and oaths so to deny
this chain which now you wear so openly
beside the charge the shame imprisonment
you have done wrong to this my honest friend
who but for staying on our controversy
had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day
this chain you had of me can you deny it
antipholus


of syracuse

i think i had i never did deny it


second merchant

yes that you did sir and forswore it too
antipholus


of syracuse

who heard me to deny it or forswear it


second merchant

these ears of mine thou know did hear thee
fie on thee wretch tis pity that thou livest

exeunt antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse to the priory
enter the lady abbess aemilia


aemelia

be quiet people wherefore throng you hither


adriana

to fetch my poor distracted husband hence
let us come in that we may bind him fast
and bear him home for his recovery


angelo

i knew he was not in his perfect wits


second merchant

i am sorry now that i did draw on him


aemelia

how long hath this possession held the man


adriana

this week he hath been heavy sour sad
and much different from the man he was
but till this afternoon his passion
neer brake into extremity of rage


aemelia

hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea
buried some dear friend hath not else his eye
stray his affection in unlawful love
a sin prevailing much in youthful men
who give their eyes the liberty of gazing
which of these sorrows is he subject to


adriana

to none of these except it be the last
namely some love that drew him oft from home


aemelia

you should for that have reprehended him


adriana

why so i did


aemelia

ay but not rough enough


adriana

as roughly as my modesty would let me


aemelia

haply in private


adriana

and in assemblies too


aemelia

ay but not enough


adriana

it was the copy of our conference
in bed he slept not for my urging it
at board he fed not for my urging it
alone it was the subject of my theme
in company i often glanced it
still did i tell him it was vile and bad


aemelia

and thereof came it that the man was mad
the venom clamours of a jealous woman
poisons more deadly than a mad dog tooth
it seems his sleeps were hinder by thy railing
and therefore comes it that his head is light
thou say his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings
unquiet meals make ill digestions
thereof the raging fire of fever bred
and what a fever but a fit of madness
thou say his sports were hinderd by thy brawls
sweet recreation barr what doth ensue
but moody and dull melancholy
kinsman to grim and comfortless despair
and at her heels a huge infectious troop
of pale distemperatures and foes to life
in food in sport and life-preserving rest
to be disturb would mad or man or beast
the consequence is then thy jealous fits
have scared thy husband from the use of wits


luciana

she never reprehended him but mildly
when he demean himself rough rude and wildly
why bear you these rebukes and answer not


adriana

she did betray me to my own reproof
good people enter and lay hold on him


aemelia

no not a creature enters in my house


adriana

then let your servants bring my husband forth


aemelia

neither he took this place for sanctuary
and it shall privilege him from your hands
till i have brought him to his wits again
or lose my labour in assaying it


adriana

i will attend my husband be his nurse
diet his sickness for it is my office
and will have no attorney but myself
and therefore let me have him home with me


aemelia

be patient for i will not let him stir
till i have used the approved means i have
with wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers
to make of him a formal man again
it is a branch and parcel of mine oath
a charitable duty of my order
therefore depart and leave him here with me


adriana

i will not hence and leave my husband here
and ill it doth beseem your holiness
to separate the husband and the wife


aemelia

be quiet and depart thou shalt not have him
exit


luciana

complain unto the duke of this indignity


adriana

come go i will fall prostrate at his feet
and never rise until my tears and prayers
have won his grace to come in person hither
and take perforce my husband from the abbess


second merchant

by this i think the dial points at five
anon im sure the duke himself in person
comes this way to the melancholy vale
the place of death and sorry execution
behind the ditches of the abbey here


angelo

upon what cause


second merchant

to see a reverend syracusian merchant
who put unluckily into this bay
against the laws and statutes of this town
beheaded publicly for his offence


angelo

see where they come we will behold his death


luciana

kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey
enter duke solinus attended aegeon bareheaded with the headsman and other officers


duke solinus

yet once again proclaim it publicly
if any friend will pay the sum for him
he shall not die so much we tender him


adriana

justice most sacred duke against the abbess


duke solinus

she is a virtuous and a reverend lady
it cannot be that she hath done thee wrong


adriana

may it please your grace antipholus my husband
whom i made lord of me and all i had
at your important letters this ill day
a most outrageous fit of madness took him
that desperately he hurried through the street
with him his bondman all as mad as he 
doing displeasure to the citizens
by rushing in their houses bearing thence
rings jewels any thing his rage did like
once did i get him bound and sent him home
whilst to take order for the wrongs i went
that here and there his fury had committed
anon i wot not by what strong escape
he broke from those that had the guard of him
and with his mad attendant and himself
each one with ireful passion with drawn swords
met us again and madly bent on us
chased us away till raising of more aid
we came again to bind them then they fled
into this abbey whither we pursued them
and here the abbess shuts the gates on us
and will not suffer us to fetch him out
nor send him forth that we may bear him hence
therefore most gracious duke with thy command
let him be brought forth and borne hence for help


duke solinus

long since thy husband served me in my wars
and i to thee engaged a prince word
when thou didst make him master of thy bed
to do him all the grace and good i could
go some of you knock at the abbey-gate
and bid the lady abbess come to me
i will determine this before i stir
enter a servant


servant

o mistress mistress shift and save yourself
my master and his man are both broke loose
beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor
whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire
and ever as it blazed they threw on him
great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair
my master preaches patience to him and the while
his man with scissors nicks him like a fool
and sure unless you send some present help
between them they will kill the conjurer


adriana

peace fool thy master and his man are here
and that is false thou dost report to us


servant

mistress upon my life i tell you true
i have not breathed almost since i did see it
he cries for you and vows if he can take you
to scorch your face and to disfigure you
cry within
hark hark i hear him mistress fly be gone

deep scars to save thy life even for the blood
that then i lost for thee now grant me justice

antipholus


of ephesus

justice sweet prince against that woman there
she whom thou gavest to me to be my wife
that hath abused and dishonour me
even in the strength and height of injury
beyond imagination is the wrong
that she this day hath shameless thrown on me


duke solinus

discover how and thou shalt find me just
antipholus


of ephesus

this day great duke she shut the doors upon me
while she with harlots feasted in my house


duke solinus

a grievous fault say woman didst thou so


adriana

no my good lord myself he and my sister
to-day did dine together so befall my soul
as this is false he burdens me withal


luciana

neer may i look on day nor sleep on night
but she tells to your highness simple truth


angelo

o perjured woman they are both forsworn
in this the madman justly chargeth them
antipholus


of ephesus

my liege i am advised what i say
neither disturbed with the effect of wine
nor heady-rash provoked with raging ire
albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad
this woman lock me out this day from dinner
that goldsmith there were he not pack with her
could witness it for he was with me then
who parted with me to go fetch a chain
promising to bring it to the porpentine
where balthazar and i did dine together
our dinner done and he not coming thither
i went to seek him in the street i met him
and in his company that gentleman
there did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
that i this day of him received the chain
which god he knows i saw not for the which
he did arrest me with an officer
i did obey and sent my peasant home
for certain ducats he with none return
then fairly i bespoke the officer
to go in person with me to my house
by the way we met
my wife her sister and a rabble more
of vile confederates along with them
they brought one pinch a hungry lean-faced villain
a mere anatomy a mountebank
a threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller
a needy hollow-eyed sharp-looking wretch
a dead-looking man this pernicious slave
forsooth took on him as a conjurer
and gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse
and with no face as twere outfacing me
cries out i was possess then all together
they fell upon me bound me bore me thence
and in a dark and dankish vault at home
there left me and my man both bound together
till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder
i gain my freedom and immediately
ran hither to your grace whom i beseech
to give me ample satisfaction
for these deep shames and great indignities


angelo

my lord in truth thus far i witness with him
that he dined not at home but was lock out


duke solinus

but had he such a chain of thee or no


angelo

he had my lord and when he ran in here
these people saw the chain about his neck


second merchant

besides i will be sworn these ears of mine
heard you confess you had the chain of him
after you first forswore it on the mart
and thereupon i drew my sword on you
and then you fled into this abbey here
from whence i think you are come by miracle
antipholus


of ephesus

i never came within these abbey-walls
nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me
i never saw the chain so help me heaven
and this is false you burden me withal


duke solinus

why what an intricate impeach is this
i think you all have drunk of circe cup
if here you housed him here he would have been
if he were mad he would not plead so coldly
you say he dined at home the goldsmith here
denies that saying sirrah what say you


dromio of ephesus

sir he dined with her there at the porpentine


courtezan

he did and from my finger snatch that ring
antipholus


of ephesus

tis true my liege this ring i had of her


duke solinus

saw thou him enter at the abbey here


courtezan

man denies you are now bound to believe him


aegeon

not know my voice o time extremity
hast thou so crack and splitted my poor tongue
in seven short years that here my only son
knows not my feeble key of untuned cares
though now this grained face of mine be hid
in sap-consuming winter drizzled snow
and all the conduits of my blood froze up
yet hath my night of life some memory
my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left
my dull deaf ears a little use to hear
all these old witnesses i cannot err 
tell me thou art my son antipholus
antipholus


of ephesus

i never saw my father in my life


aegeon

but seven years since in syracusa boy
thou know we parted but perhaps my son
thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery
antipholus


of ephesus

the duke and all that know me in the city
can witness with me that it is not so
i neer saw syracusa in my life


duke solinus

o if thou be the same aegeon speak

aegeon

if thou art she tell me where is that son
that floated with thee on the fatal raft


aemelia

and the twin dromio all were taken up
but by and by rude fishermen of corinth
by force took dromio and my son from them
and me they left with those of epidamnum
what then became of them i cannot tell
i to this fortune that you see me in


duke solinus

the tragedy of coriolanus

act i
scene i rome a street

enter a company of mutinous citizens with staves clubs and other weapons


first citizen

before we proceed any further hear me speak


all

speak speak


first citizen

you are all resolved rather to die than to famish


all

resolved resolved


first citizen

first you know caius marcius is chief enemy to the people


all

we knowt we knowt


first citizen

let us kill him and well have corn at our own price
ist a verdict


all

no more talking ont let it be done away away


second citizen

one word good citizens


first citizen

we are accounted poor citizens the patricians good
what authority surfeits on would relieve us if they
would yield us but the superfluity while it were
wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely
but they think we are too dear the leanness that
afflicts us the object of our misery is as an
inventory to particularise their abundance our
sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with
our pikes ere we become rakes for the gods know i
speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge


second citizen

would you proceed especially against caius marcius


all

against him first he a very dog to the commonalty


second citizen

consider you what services he has done for his country


first citizen

very well and could be content to give him good
report fort but that he pays himself with being proud


second citizen

nay but speak not maliciously


first citizen

i say unto you what he hath done famously he did
it to that end though soft-conscienced men can be
content to say it was for his country he did it to
please his mother and to be partly proud which he
is even till the altitude of his virtue


second citizen

what he cannot help in his nature you account a
vice in him you must in no way say he is covetous


first citizen

if i must not i need not be barren of accusations
he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition
shouts within
what shouts are these the other side o the city
is risen why stay we prating here to the capitol


all

come come


first citizen

soft who comes here
enter menenius agrippa


second citizen

worthy menenius agrippa one that hath always loved
the people


first citizen

he one honest enough would all the rest were so


menenius

what work my countrymen in hand where go you
with bats and clubs the matter speak i pray you


first citizen

our business is not unknown to the senate they have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do
which now well show em in deeds they say poor
suitors have strong breaths they shall know we
have strong arms too


menenius

why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours
will you undo yourselves


first citizen

we cannot sir we are undone already


menenius

i tell you friends most charitable care
have the patricians of you for your wants
your suffering in this dearth you may as well
strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
against the roman state whose course will on
the way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs
of more strong link asunder than can ever
appear in your impediment for the dearth
the gods not the patricians make it and
your knees to them not arms must help alack
you are transported by calamity
thither where more attends you and you slander
the helms o the state who care for you like fathers
when you curse them as enemies


first citizen

care for us true indeed they neer cared for us
yet suffer us to famish and their store-houses
crammed with grain make edicts for usury to
support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act
established against the rich and provide more
piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain
the poor if the wars eat us not up they will and
there all the love they bear us


menenius

either you must
confess yourselves wondrous malicious
or be accused of folly i shall tell you
a pretty tale it may be you have heard it
but since it serves my purpose i will venture
to stale t a little more


first citizen

well ill hear it sir yet you must not think to
fob off our disgrace with a tale but an t please
you deliver


menenius

there was a time when all the body members
rebell against the belly thus accused it
that only like a gulf it did remain
i the midst o the body idle and unactive
still cupboarding the viand never bearing
like labour with the rest where the other instruments
did see and hear devise instruct walk feel
and mutually participate did minister
unto the appetite and affection common
of the whole body the belly answer 


first citizen

well sir what answer made the belly


menenius

sir i shall tell you with a kind of smile
which neer came from the lungs but even thus 
for look you i may make the belly smile
as well as speak it tauntingly replied
to the discontented members the mutinous parts
that envied his receipt even so most fitly
as you malign our senators for that
they are not such as you


first citizen

your belly answer what
the kingly-crowned head the vigilant eye
the counsellor heart the arm our soldier
our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter
with other muniments and petty helps
in this our fabric if that they 


menenius

what then
fore me this fellow speaks what then what then


first citizen

should by the cormorant belly be restrain
who is the sink o the body 


menenius

well what then


first citizen

the former agents if they did complain
what could the belly answer


menenius

i will tell you
if youll bestow a small of what you have little 
patience awhile youll hear the belly answer


first citizen

yere long about it


menenius

note me this good friend
your most grave belly was deliberate
not rash like his accusers and thus answer
true is it my incorporate friends quoth he
that i receive the general food at first
which you do live upon and fit it is
because i am the store-house and the shop
of the whole body but if you do remember
i send it through the rivers of your blood
even to the court the heart to the seat o the brain
and through the cranks and offices of man
the strongest nerves and small inferior veins
from me receive that natural competency
whereby they live and though that all at once
you my good friends this says the belly mark me 


first citizen

ay sir well well


menenius

though all at once cannot
see what i do deliver out to each
yet i can make my audit up that all
from me do back receive the flour of all
and leave me but the bran what say you tot


first citizen

it was an answer how apply you this


menenius

the senators of rome are this good belly
and you the mutinous members for examine
their counsels and their cares digest things rightly
touching the weal o the common you shall find
no public benefit which you receive
but it proceeds or comes from them to you
and no way from yourselves what do you think
you the great toe of this assembly


first citizen

i the great toe why the great toe


menenius

for that being one o the lowest basest poorest
of this most wise rebellion thou go foremost
thou rascal that art worst in blood to run
lead first to win some vantage
but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs
rome and her rats are at the point of battle
the one side must have bale
enter caius marcius
hail noble marcius


marcius

thanks what the matter you dissentious rogues
that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion
make yourselves scabs


first citizen

we have ever your good word


marcius

he that will give good words to thee will flatter
beneath abhorring what would you have you curs
that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you
the other makes you proud he that trusts to you
where he should find you lions finds you hares
where foxes geese you are no surer no
than is the coal of fire upon the ice
or hailstone in the sun your virtue is
to make him worthy whose offence subdues him
and curse that justice did it
who deserves greatness
deserves your hate and your affections are
a sick man appetite who desires most that
which would increase his evil he that depends
upon your favours swims with fins of lead
and hews down oaks with rushes hang ye trust ye
with every minute you do change a mind
and call him noble that was now your hate
him vile that was your garland what the matter
that in these several places of the city
you cry against the noble senate who
under the gods keep you in awe which else
would feed on one another what their seeking


menenius

for corn at their own rates whereof they say
the city is well stored


marcius

hang em they say
theyll sit by the fire and presume to know
what done i the capitol who like to rise
who thrives and who declines side factions
and give out
conjectural marriages making parties strong
and feebling such as stand not in their liking
below their cobbled shoes they say there
grain enough
would the nobility lay aside their ruth
and let me use my sword ill make a quarry
with thousands of these quarter slaves as high
as i could pick my lance


menenius

nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded
for though abundantly they lack discretion
yet are they passing cowardly but i beseech you
what says the other troop


marcius

they are dissolved hang em
they said they were an-hungry sigh forth proverbs
that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat
that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not
corn for the rich men only with these shreds
they vented their complainings which being answer
and a petition granted them a strange one 
to break the heart of generosity
and make bold power look pale they threw their caps
as they would hang them on the horns o the moon
shouting their emulation


menenius

what is granted them


marcius

five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms
of their own choice one junius brutus
sicinius velutus and i know not death
the rabble should have first unroof the city
ere so prevail with me it will in time
win upon power and throw forth greater themes
for insurrection arguing


menenius

this is strange


marcius

go get you home you fragments
enter a messenger hastily


messenger

where caius marcius


marcius

here what the matter


messenger

the news is sir the volsces are in arms


marcius

i am glad on t then we shall ha means to vent
our musty superfluity see our best elders
enter cominius titus lartius and other senators junius brutus and sicinius velutus


first senator

marcius tis true that you have lately told us
the volsces are in arms


marcius

they have a leader
tullus aufidius that will put you to t
i sin in envying his nobility
and were i any thing but what i am
i would wish me only he


cominius

you have fought together


marcius

were half to half the world by the ears and he
upon my party ild revolt to make
only my wars with him he is a lion
that i am proud to hunt


first senator

then worthy marcius
attend upon cominius to these wars


cominius

it is your former promise


marcius

sir it is
and i am constant titus lartius thou
shalt see me once more strike at tullus face
what art thou stiff stand out


titus

no caius marcius
ill lean upon one crutch and fight with tother
ere stay behind this business


menenius

o true-bred


first senator

your company to the capitol where i know
our greatest friends attend us


titus

to cominius                lead you on
to marcius
right worthy you priority


cominius

noble marcius


first senator

to the citizens  hence to your homes be gone


marcius

nay let them follow
the volsces have much corn take these rats thither
to gnaw their garners worshipful mutiners
your valour puts well forth pray follow
citizens steal away exeunt all but sicinius and brutus


sicinius

was ever man so proud as is this marcius


brutus

he has no equal


sicinius

when we were chosen tribunes for the people 


brutus

mark you his lip and eyes


sicinius

nay but his taunts


brutus

being moved he will not spare to gird the gods


sicinius

be-mock the modest moon


brutus

the present wars devour him he is grown
too proud to be so valiant


sicinius

such a nature
tickled with good success disdains the shadow
which he treads on at noon but i do wonder
his insolence can brook to be commanded
under cominius


brutus

fame at the which he aims
in whom already he well graced can not
better be held nor more attain than by
a place below the first for what miscarries
shall be the general fault though he perform
to the utmost of a man and giddy censure
will then cry out of marcius o if he
had borne the business


sicinius

besides if things go well
opinion that so sticks on marcius shall
of his demerits rob cominius


brutus

come
half all cominius honours are to marcius
though marcius earned them not and all his faults
to marcius shall be honours though indeed
in aught he merit not


sicinius

let hence and hear
how the dispatch is made and in what fashion
more than his singularity he goes
upon this present action


brutus

lets along
exeunt

scene ii corioli the senate-house

enter tullus aufidius and certain senators


first senator

so your opinion is aufidius
that they of rome are entered in our counsels
and know how we proceed


aufidius

is it not yours
what ever have been thought on in this state
that could be brought to bodily act ere rome
had circumvention tis not four days gone
since i heard thence these are the words i think
i have the letter here yes here it is
reads
they have press a power but it is not known
whether for east or west the dearth is great
the people mutinous and it is rumour
cominius marcius your old enemy
who is of rome worse hated than of you
and titus lartius a most valiant roman
these three lead on this preparation
whither tis bent most likely tis for you
consider of it


first senator

our army in the field
we never yet made doubt but rome was ready
to answer us


aufidius

nor did you think it folly
to keep your great pretences veil till when
they needs must show themselves which
in the hatching
it seem appear to rome by the discovery
we shall be shorten in our aim which was
to take in many towns ere almost rome
should know we were afoot


second senator

noble aufidius
take your commission hie you to your bands
let us alone to guard corioli
if they set down before  for the remove
bring your army but i think youll find
theyve not prepared for us


aufidius

o doubt not that
i speak from certainties nay more
some parcels of their power are forth already
and only hitherward i leave your honours
if we and caius marcius chance to meet
tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
till one can do no more


all

the gods assist you


aufidius

and keep your honours safe


first senator

farewell


second senator

farewell

enter volumnia and virgiliathey set them down on two low stools and sew


volumnia

i pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a
more comfortable sort if my son were my husband i
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
he would show most love when yet he was but
tender-bodied and the only son of my womb when
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way when
for a day of kings entreaties a mother should not
sell him an hour from her beholding i considering
how honour would become such a person that it was
no better than picture-like to hang by the wall if
renown made it not stir was pleased to let him seek
danger where he was like to find fame to a cruel
war i sent him from whence he returned his brows
bound with oak i tell thee daughter i sprang not
more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
man


virgilia

but had he died in the business madam how then


volumnia

then his good report should have been my son i
therein would have found issue hear me profess
sincerely had i a dozen sons each in my love

country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action

like to a harvest-man that task to mow
or all or lose his hire


virgilia

volumnia

away you fool it more becomes a man

following the fliers at the very heels
with them he enters who upon the sudden
clapp to their gates he is himself alone
to answer all the city


lartius

o noble fellow
who sensibly outdares his senseless sword
and when it bows stands up thou art left marcius
a carbuncle entire as big as thou art
were not so rich a jewel thou wast a soldier
even to cato wish not fierce and terrible
only in strokes but with thy grim looks and
the thunder-like percussion of thy sounds
thou madst thine enemies shake as if the world
were feverous and did tremble
re-enter marcius bleeding assaulted by the enemy


first soldier

look sir


lartius

otis marcius
let fetch him off or make remain alike
they fight and all enter the city

scene v corioli a street

enter certain romans with spoils


first roman

second roman

third roman

a murrain ont i took this for silver
alarum continues still afar off
enter marcius and titus lartius with a trumpet


marcius

see here these movers that do prize their hours
at a crack drachm cushions leaden spoons
irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would
bury with those that wore them these base slaves
ere yet the fight be done pack up down with them
and hark what noise the general makes to him
there is the man of my soul hate aufidius
piercing our romans then valiant titus take
convenient numbers to make good the city
whilst i with those that have the spirit will haste
to help cominius


lartius

worthy sir thou bleed
thy exercise hath been too violent for
a second course of fight


marcius

sir praise me not
my work hath yet not warm me fare you well
the blood i drop is rather physical
than dangerous to me to aufidius thus
i will appear and fight


lartius

now the fair goddess fortune
fall deep in love with thee and her great charms
misguide thy opposers swords bold gentleman
prosperity be thy page


marcius

thy friend no less
than those she placeth highest so farewell


lartius

thou worthiest marcius
exit marcius
go sound thy trumpet in the market-place
call thither all the officers o the town
where they shall know our mind away

scene vi near the camp of cominius

enter cominius as it were in retire with soldiers


cominius

breathe you my friends well fought
we are come off
like romans neither foolish in our stands
nor cowardly in retire believe me sirs
we shall be charged again whiles we have struck
by interims and conveying gusts we have heard
the charges of our friends ye roman gods
lead their successes as we wish our own
that both our powers with smiling
fronts encountering
may give you thankful sacrifice
enter a messenger
thy news


messenger

the citizens of corioli have issued
and given to lartius and to marcius battle
i saw our party to their trenches driven
and then i came away


cominius

though thou speak truth
methinks thou speak not well
how long ist since


messenger

above an hour my lord


cominius

tis not a mile briefly we heard their drums
how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour
and bring thy news so late


messenger

spies of the volsces
held me in chase that i was forced to wheel
three or four miles about else had i sir
half an hour since brought my report


cominius

who yonder
that does appear as he were flay o gods
he has the stamp of marcius and i have
before-time seen him thus


marcius

within                 come i too late


cominius

the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
more than i know the sound of marcius tongue
from every meaner man
enter marcius


marcius

come i too late


cominius

ay if you come not in the blood of others
but mantled in your own


marcius

o let me clip ye
in arms as sound as when i woo in heart
as merry as when our nuptial day was done
and tapers burn to bedward


cominius

flower of warriors
how is it with titus lartius


marcius

as with a man busied about decrees
condemning some to death and some to exile
ransoming him or pitying threatening the other
holding corioli in the name of rome
even like a fawning greyhound in the leash
to let him slip at will


cominius

where is that slave
which told me they had beat you to your trenches
where is he call him hither


marcius

let him alone
he did inform the truth but for our gentlemen
the common file a plague tribunes for them 
the mouse neer shunn the cat as they did budge
from rascals worse than they


cominius

but how prevail you


marcius

will the time serve to tell i do not think
where is the enemy are you lords o the field
if not why cease you till you are so


cominius

marcius
we have at disadvantage fought and did
retire to win our purpose


marcius

how lies their battle know you on which side
they have placed their men of trust


cominius

as i guess marcius
their bands i the vaward are the antiates
of their best trust oer them aufidius
their very heart of hope


marcius

i do beseech you
by all the battles wherein we have fought
by the blood we have shed together by the vows
we have made to endure friends that you directly
set me against aufidius and his antiates
and that you not delay the present but
filling the air with swords advanced and darts
we prove this very hour


cominius

though i could wish
you were conducted to a gentle bath
and balms applied to you yet dare i never
deny your asking take your choice of those
that best can aid your action


marcius

those are they
that most are willing if any such be here 
as it were sin to doubt that love this painting
wherein you see me smear if any fear
lesser his person than an ill report
if any think brave death outweighs bad life
and that his country dearer than himself
let him alone or so many so minded
wave thus to express his disposition
and follow marcius
they all shout and wave their swords take him up in their arms and cast up their caps
o me alone make you a sword of me
if these shows be not outward which of you
but is four volsces none of you but is
able to bear against the great aufidius
a shield as hard as his a certain number
though thanks to all must i select
from all the rest
shall bear the business in some other fight
as cause will be obey please you to march
and four shall quickly draw out my command
which men are best inclined


cominius

march on my fellows
make good this ostentation and you shall
divide in all with us

lartius

so let the ports be guarded keep your duties
as i have set them down if i do send dispatch
those centuries to our aid the rest will serve
for a short holding if we lose the field
we cannot keep the town

scene viii a field of battle

alarum as in battle enter from opposite sides marcius and aufidius


marcius

ill fight with none but thee for i do hate thee
worse than a promise-breaker


aufidius

we hate alike
not afric owns a serpent i abhor
more than thy fame and envy fix thy foot


marcius

let the first budger die the other slave
and the gods doom him after


aufidius

if i fly marcius
holloa me like a hare


marcius

within these three hours tullus
alone i fought in your corioli walls
and made what work i pleased tis not my blood
wherein thou seest me mask for thy revenge
wrench up thy power to the highest


aufidius

wert thou the hector
that was the whip of your bragg progeny
thou shouldst not scape me here
they fight and certain volsces come to the aid of  aufidius marcius fights till they be driven in breathless
officious and not valiant you have shamed me
in your condemned seconds
exeunt

scene ix the roman camp

flourish alarum a retreat is sounded flourish  enter from one side cominius with the romans from the other side marcius with his arm in a scarf


cominius

if i should tell thee oer this thy day work
thouldst not believe thy deeds but ill report it
where senators shall mingle tears with smiles
where great patricians shall attend and shrug
i the end admire where ladies shall be frighted
and gladly quaked hear more where the
dull tribunes
that with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours
shall say against their hearts we thank the gods
our rome hath such a soldier
yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast
having fully dined before
enter titus lartius with his power from the pursuit


lartius

o general
here is the steed we the caparison
hadst thou beheld 


marcius

pray now no more my mother
who has a charter to extol her blood
when she does praise me grieves me i have done
as you have done that what i can induced
as you have been that for my country
he that has but effected his good will
hath overtaen mine act


cominius

you shall not be
the grave of your deserving rome must know
the value of her own twere a concealment
worse than a theft no less than a traducement
to hide your doings and to silence that
which to the spire and top of praises vouch
would seem but modest therefore i beseech you
in sign of what you are not to reward
what you have done before our army hear me


marcius

i have some wounds upon me and they smart
to hear themselves remember


cominius

should they not
well might they fester gainst ingratitude
and tent themselves with death of all the horses
whereof we have taen good and good store of all
the treasure in this field achieved and city
we render you the tenth to be taen forth
before the common distribution at
your only choice


marcius

i thank you general
but cannot make my heart consent to take
a bribe to pay my sword i do refuse it
and stand upon my common part with those
that have beheld the doing
a long flourish they all cry marcius marcius  cast up their caps and lances cominius and lartius stand bare


marcius

may these same instruments which you profane
never sound more when drums and trumpets shall
i the field prove flatterers let courts and cities be
made all of false-faced soothing
when steel grows soft as the parasite silk
let him be made a coverture for the wars
no more i say for that i have not wash
my nose that bled or foil some debile wretch 
which without note here many else have done 
you shout me forth
in acclamations hyperbolical
as if i loved my little should be dieted
in praises sauced with lies


cominius

too modest are you
more cruel to your good report than grateful
to us that give you truly by your patience
if gainst yourself you be incensed well put you
like one that means his proper harm in manacles
then reason safely with you therefore be it known
as to us to all the world that caius marcius
wears this war garland in token of the which
my noble steed known to the camp i give him
with all his trim belonging and from this time
for what he did before corioli call him
with all the applause and clamour of the host
caius marcius coriolanus bear
the addition nobly ever
flourish trumpets sound and drums


all

caius marcius coriolanus


coriolanus

i will go wash
and when my face is fair you shall perceive
whether i blush or no howbeit i thank you
i mean to stride your steed and at all times
to undercrest your good addition
to the fairness of my power


cominius

so to our tent
where ere we do repose us we will write
to rome of our success you titus lartius
must to corioli back send us to rome
the best with whom we may articulate
for their own good and ours

aufidius

condition
i would i were a roman for i cannot
being a volsce be that i am condition
what good condition can a treaty find
i the part that is at mercy five times marcius
i have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me
and wouldst do so i think should we encounter
as often as we eat by the elements
if eer again i meet him beard to beard
he mine or i am his mine emulation
hath not that honour int it had for where
i thought to crush him in an equal force
true sword to sword ill potch at him some way
or wrath or craft may get him


first soldier

aufidius

bolder though not so subtle my valour poison
with only suffering stain by him for him
shall fly out of itself nor sleep nor sanctuary
being naked sick nor fane nor capitol
the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice
embarquements all of fury shall lift up
their rotten privilege and custom gainst
my hate to marcius where i find him were it
at home upon my brother guard even there
against the hospitable canon would i
wash my fierce hand in heart go you to the city
learn how tis held and what they are that must
be hostages for rome


first soldier

will not you go

act ii
scene i rome a public place

enter menenius with the two tribunes of the people sicinius and brutus


menenius

the augurer tells me we shall have news to-night


brutus

good or bad


menenius

not according to the prayer of the people for they
love not marcius


sicinius

nature teaches beasts to know their friends


menenius

pray you who does the wolf love


sicinius

the lamb


menenius

ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the
noble marcius


brutus

he a lamb indeed that baes like a bear


menenius

he a bear indeed that lives like a lamb you two
are old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you


both

well sir


menenius

in what enormity is marcius poor in that you two
have not in abundance


brutus

he poor in no one fault but stored with all


sicinius

especially in pride


brutus

and topping all others in boasting


menenius

this is strange now do you two know how you are
censured here in the city i mean of us o the
right-hand file do you


both

why how are we censured


menenius

because you talk of pride now will you not be angry


both

well well sir well


menenius

why tis no great matter for a very little thief of
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience
give your dispositions the reins and be angry at
your pleasures at the least if you take it as a
pleasure to you in being so you blame marcius for
being proud


brutus

we do it not alone sir


menenius

i know you can do very little alone for your helps
are many or else your actions would grow wondrous
single your abilities are too infant-like for
doing much alone you talk of pride o that you
could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks
and make but an interior survey of your good selves
o that you could


brutus

what then sir


menenius

why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting
proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as
any in rome


sicinius

menenius you are known well enough too


menenius

i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
tiber int said to be something imperfect in
favouring the first complaint hasty and tinder-like
upon too trivial motion one that converses more
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
of the morning what i think i utter and spend my
malice in my breath meeting two such wealsmen as
you are i cannot call you lycurguses if the drink
you give me touch my palate adversely i make a
crooked face at it i cant say your worships have
delivered the matter well when i find the ass in
compound with the major part of your syllables and
though i must be content to bear with those that say
you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that
tell you you have good faces if you see this in
the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known
well enough too what barm can your bisson
conspectuities glean out of this character if i be
known well enough too


brutus

come sir come we know you well enough


menenius

you know neither me yourselves nor any thing you
are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs you
wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller
and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
second day of audience when you are hearing a
matter between party and party if you chance to be
pinched with the colic you make faces like
mummers set up the bloody flag against all
patience and in roaring for a chamber-pot
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
by your hearing all the peace you make in their
cause is calling both the parties knaves you are
a pair of strange ones


brutus

come come you are well understood to be a
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
bencher in the capitol


menenius

our very priests must become mockers if they shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when
you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the
wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher
cushion or to be entombed in an ass pack-
saddle yet you must be saying marcius is proud
who in a cheap estimation is worth predecessors
since deucalion though peradventure some of the
best of em were hereditary hangmen god-den to
your worships more of your conversation would
infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly
plebeians i will be bold to take my leave of you
brutus and sicinius go aside
enter volumnia virgilia and valeria
how now my as fair as noble ladies and the moon
were she earthly no nobler whither do you follow
your eyes so fast


volumnia

virgilia

menenius

a letter for me it gives me an estate of seven
years health in which time i will make a lip at
the physician the most sovereign prescription in
galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative
of no better report than a horse-drench is he
not wounded he was wont to come home wounded


virgilia

o no no no


volumnia

o he is wounded i thank the gods fort


menenius

so do i too if it be not too much brings a
victory in his pocket the wounds become him


volumnia

on brows menenius he comes the third time home
with the oaken garland


menenius

has he disciplined aufidius soundly


volumnia

titus lartius writes they fought together but
aufidius got off


menenius

and twas time for him too ill warrant him that
an he had stayed by him i would not have been so
fidiused for all the chests in corioli and the gold
that in them is the senate possessed of this


volumnia

good ladies let go yes yes yes the senate
has letters from the general wherein he gives my
son the whole name of the war he hath in this
action outdone his former deeds doubly


valeria

in troth there wondrous things spoke of him


menenius

wondrous ay i warrant you and not without his
true purchasing


virgilia

the gods grant them true


volumnia

true pow wow


menenius

true ill be sworn they are true
where is he wounded
to the tribunes
god save your good worships marcius is coming
home he has more cause to be proud where is he wounded


volumnia

i the shoulder and i the left arm there will be
large cicatrices to show the people when he shall
stand for his place he received in the repulse of
tarquin seven hurts i the body


menenius

one i the neck and two i the thigh there
nine that i know


volumnia

he had before this last expedition twenty-five
wounds upon him


menenius

now it twenty-seven every gash was an enemy grave
a shout and flourish
hark the trumpets


volumnia

these are the ushers of marcius before him he
carries noise and behind him he leaves tears
death that dark spirit in  nervy arm doth lie
which being advanced declines and then men die
a sennet trumpets sound enter cominius the  general and titus lartius between them coriolanus  crowned with an oaken garland with captains and soldiers and a herald


herald

know rome that all alone marcius did fight
within corioli gates where he hath won
with fame a name to caius marcius these
in honour follows coriolanus
welcome to rome renowned coriolanus

all

welcome to rome renowned coriolanus


coriolanus

no more of this it does offend my heart
pray now no more


cominius

coriolanus

for my prosperity
kneels


volumnia

nay my good soldier up
my gentle marcius worthy caius and
by deed-achieving honour newly named 
what is it coriolanus must i call thee 
but o thy wife


coriolanus

my gracious silence hail
wouldst thou have laugh had i come coffin home
that weep to see me triumph ay my dear
such eyes the widows in corioli wear
and mothers that lack sons


menenius

now the gods crown thee


coriolanus

and live you yet
to valeria
o my sweet lady pardon


volumnia

i know not where to turn o welcome home
and welcome general and yere welcome all


menenius

a hundred thousand welcomes i could weep
and i could laugh i am light and heavy welcome
a curse begin at very root on heart
that is not glad to see thee you are three
that rome should dote on yet by the faith of men
we have some old crab-trees here
at home that will not
be grafted to your relish yet welcome warriors
we call a nettle but a nettle and
the faults of fools but folly


cominius

ever right


coriolanus

menenius ever ever


herald

give way there and go on


coriolanus

to volumnia and virgilia  your hand and yours
ere in our own house i do shade my head
the good patricians must be visited
from whom i have received not only greetings
but with them change of honours


volumnia

i have lived
to see inherited my very wishes
and the buildings of my fancy only
there one thing wanting which i doubt not but
our rome will cast upon thee


coriolanus

know good mother
i had rather be their servant in my way
than sway with them in theirs


cominius

on to the capitol
flourish cornets exeunt in state as before brutus and sicinius come forward


brutus

all tongues speak of him and the bleared sights
are spectacled to see him your prattling nurse
into a rapture lets her baby cry
while she chats him the kitchen malkin pins
her richest lockram bout her reechy neck
clambering the walls to eye him stalls bulks windows
are smother up leads fill and ridges horsed
with variable complexions all agreeing
in earnestness to see him seld-shown flamens
do press among the popular throngs and puff
to win a vulgar station or veil dames
commit the war of white and damask in
their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
of phoebus burning kisses such a pother
as if that whatsoever god who leads him
were slily crept into his human powers
and gave him graceful posture


sicinius

on the sudden
i warrant him consul


brutus

then our office may
during his power go sleep


sicinius

he cannot temperately transport his honours
from where he should begin and end but will
lose those he hath won


brutus

in that there comfort


sicinius

doubt not
the commoners for whom we stand but they
upon their ancient malice will forget
with the least cause these his new honours which
that he will give them make i as little question
as he is proud to dot


brutus

i heard him swear
were he to stand for consul never would he
appear i the market-place nor on him put
the napless vesture of humility
nor showing as the manner is his wounds
to the people beg their stinking breaths


sicinius

tis right


brutus

it was his word o he would miss it rather
than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
and the desire of the nobles


sicinius

i wish no better
than have him hold that purpose and to put it
in execution


brutus

tis most like he will


sicinius

it shall be to him then as our good wills
a sure destruction


brutus

so it must fall out
to him or our authorities for an end
we must suggest the people in what hatred
he still hath held them that to power he would
have made them mules silenced their pleaders and
dispropertied their freedoms holding them
in human action and capacity
of no more soul nor fitness for the world
than camels in the war who have their provand
only for bearing burdens and sore blows
for sinking under them


sicinius

this as you say suggested
at some time when his soaring insolence
shall touch the people which time shall not want
if he be put upon t and that as easy
as to set dogs on sheep will be his fire
to kindle their dry stubble and their blaze
shall darken him for ever
enter a messenger


brutus

what the matter


messenger

you are sent for to the capitol tis thought
that marcius shall be consul
i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
the blind to bear him speak matrons flung gloves
ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers
upon him as he pass the nobles bended
as to jove statue and the commons made
a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts
i never saw the like


brutus

let to the capitol
and carry with us ears and eyes for the time
but hearts for the event


sicinius

have with you
exeunt

scene ii the same the capitol

enter two officers to lay cushions


first officer

come come they are almost here how many stand
for consulships


second officer

three they say but tis thought of every one
coriolanus will carry it


first officer

that a brave fellow but he vengeance proud and
loves not the common people


second officer

faith there had been many great men that have
flattered the people who neer loved them and there
be many that they have loved they know not
wherefore so that if they love they know not why
they hate upon no better a ground therefore for
coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets
them plainly seet


first officer

if he did not care whether he had their love or no
he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither
good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater
devotion than can render it him and leaves
nothing undone that may fully discover him their
opposite now to seem to affect the malice and
displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
dislikes to flatter them for their love


second officer

he hath deserved worthily of his country and his
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who
having been supple and courteous to the people
bonneted without any further deed to have them at
an into their estimation and report but he hath so
planted his honours in their eyes and his actions
in their hearts that for their tongues to be
silent and not confess so much were a kind of
ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a
malice that giving itself the lie would pluck
reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it


first officer

no more of him he is a worthy man make way they
are coming
a sennet enter with actors before them cominius  the consul menenius coriolanus senators  sicinius and brutus the senators take their  places the tribunes take their places by themselves coriolanus stands


menenius

having determined of the volsces and
to send for titus lartius it remains
as the main point of this our after-meeting
to gratify his noble service that
hath thus stood for his country therefore
please you
most reverend and grave elders to desire
the present consul and last general
in our well-found successes to report
a little of that worthy work perform
by caius marcius coriolanus whom
we met here both to thank and to remember
with honours like himself


first senator

speak good cominius
leave nothing out for length and make us think
rather our state defective for requital
than we to stretch it out
to the tribunes
masters o the people
we do request your kindest ears and after
your loving motion toward the common body
to yield what passes here


sicinius

we are convented
upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts
inclinable to honour and advance
the theme of our assembly


brutus

which the rather
we shall be blest to do if he remember
a kinder value of the people than
he hath hereto prized them at


menenius

that off that off
i would you rather had been silent please you
to hear cominius speak


brutus

most willingly
but yet my caution was more pertinent
than the rebuke you give it


menenius

he loves your people
but tie him not to be their bedfellow
worthy cominius speak
coriolanus offers to go away
nay keep your place


first senator

sit coriolanus never shame to hear
what you have nobly done


coriolanus

your horror pardon
i had rather have my wounds to heal again
than hear say how i got them


brutus

sir i hope
my words disbench you not


coriolanus

no sir yet oft
when blows have made me stay i fled from words
you soothed not therefore hurt not but
your people
i love them as they weigh


menenius

pray now sit down


coriolanus

i had rather have one scratch my head i the sun
when the alarum were struck than idly sit
to hear my nothings monster
exit


menenius

masters of the people
your multiplying spawn how can he flatter 
that thousand to one good one when you now see
he had rather venture all his limbs for honour
than one on ears to hear it proceed cominius


cominius

i shall lack voice the deeds of coriolanus
should not be utter feebly it is held
that valour is the chiefest virtue and
most dignifies the haver if it be
the man i speak of cannot in the world
be singly counterpoised at sixteen years
when tarquin made a head for rome he fought
beyond the mark of others our then dictator
whom with all praise i point at saw him fight
when with his amazonian chin he drove
the bristled lips before him be bestrid
an oer-press roman and i the consul view
slew three opposers tarquin self he met
and struck him on his knee in that day feats
when he might act the woman in the scene
he proved best man i the field and for his meed
was brow-bound with the oak his pupil age
man-enter thus he waxed like a sea
and in the brunt of seventeen battles since
he lurch all swords of the garland for this last
before and in corioli let me say
i cannot speak him home he stopp the fliers
and by his rare example made the coward
turn terror into sport as weeds before
a vessel under sail so men obey
and fell below his stem his sword death stamp
where it did mark it took from face to foot
he was a thing of blood whose every motion
was timed with dying cries alone he enter
the mortal gate of the city which he painted
with shunless destiny aidless came off
and with a sudden reinforcement struck
corioli like a planet now all his
when by and by the din of war gan pierce
his ready sense then straight his doubled spirit
re-quicken what in flesh was fatigate
and to the battle came he where he did
run reeking oer the lives of men as if
twere a perpetual spoil and till we call
both field and city ours he never stood
to ease his breast with panting


menenius

worthy man


first senator

he cannot but with measure fit the honours
which we devise him


cominius

our spoils he kick at
and look upon things precious as they were
the common muck of the world he covets less
than misery itself would give rewards
his deeds with doing them and is content
to spend the time to end it


menenius

he right noble
let him be call for


first senator

call coriolanus


officer

he doth appear
re-enter coriolanus


menenius

the senate coriolanus are well pleased
to make thee consul


coriolanus

i do owe them still
my life and services


menenius

it then remains
that you do speak to the people


coriolanus

i do beseech you
let me oerleap that custom for i cannot
put on the gown stand naked and entreat them
for my wounds sake to give their suffrage please you
that i may pass this doing


sicinius

sir the people
must have their voices neither will they bate
one jot of ceremony


menenius

put them not tot
pray you go fit you to the custom and
take to you as your predecessors have
your honour with your form


coriolanus

it is apart
that i shall blush in acting and might well
be taken from the people


brutus

mark you that


coriolanus

to brag unto them thus i did and thus
show them the unaching scars which i should hide
as if i had received them for the hire
of their breath only


menenius

do not stand upont
we recommend to you tribunes of the people
our purpose to them and to our noble consul
wish we all joy and honour


senators

to coriolanus come all joy and honour
flourish of cornets exeunt all but sicinius and brutus


brutus

you see how he intends to use the people


sicinius

may they perceive intent he will require them
as if he did contemn what he requested
should be in them to give


brutus

come well inform them
of our proceedings here on the marketplace
i know they do attend us
exeunt

scene iii the same the forum

enter seven or eight citizens


first citizen

once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him


second citizen

we may sir if we will


third citizen

we have power in ourselves to do it but it is a
power that we have no power to do for if he show us
his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our
tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if
he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him
our noble acceptance of them ingratitude is
monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful
were to make a monster of the multitude of the
which we being members should bring ourselves to be
monstrous members


first citizen

and to make us no better thought of a little help
will serve for once we stood up about the corn he
himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude


third citizen

we have been called so of many not that our heads
are some brown some black some auburn some bald
but that our wits are so diversely coloured and
truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of
one skull they would fly east west north south
and their consent of one direct way should be at
once to all the points o the compass


second citizen

think you so which way do you judge my wit would
fly


third citizen

nay your wit will not so soon out as another man
willtis strongly wedged up in a block-head but
if it were at liberty twould sure southward


second citizen

why that way


third citizen

to lose itself in a fog where being three parts
melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return
for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife


second citizen

you are never without your tricks you may you may


third citizen

are you all resolved to give your voices but
that no matter the greater part carries it i
say if he would incline to the people there was
never a worthier man
enter coriolanus in a gown of humility with menenius
here he comes and in the gown of humility mark his
behavior we are not to stay all together but to
come by him where he stands by ones by twos and
by threes he to make his requests by
particulars wherein every one of us has a single
honour in giving him our own voices with our own
tongues therefore follow me and i direct you how
you shall go by him


all

content content
exeunt citizens


menenius

o sir you are not right have you not known
the worthiest men have donet


coriolanus

what must i say
i pray sir plague upont i cannot bring
my tongue to such a pace look sir my wounds
i got them in my country service when
some certain of your brethren roar and ran
from the noise of our own drums


menenius

o me the gods
you must not speak of that you must desire them
to think upon you


coriolanus

think upon me hang em
i would they would forget me like the virtues
which our divines lose by em


menenius

youll mar all
ill leave you pray you speak to em i pray you
in wholesome manner
exit


coriolanus

bid them wash their faces
and keep their teeth clean
re-enter two of the citizens
so here comes a brace
re-enter a third citizen
you know the cause air of my standing here


third citizen

we do sir tell us what hath brought you tot


coriolanus

mine own desert


second citizen

your own desert


coriolanus

ay but not mine own desire


third citizen

how not your own desire


coriolanus

no sirtwas never my desire yet to trouble the
poor with begging


third citizen

you must think if we give you any thing we hope to
gain by you


coriolanus

well then i pray your price o the consulship


first citizen

the price is to ask it kindly


coriolanus

kindly sir i pray let me hat i have wounds to
show you which shall be yours in private your
good voice sir what say you


second citizen

you shall ha it worthy sir


coriolanus

a match sir there in all two worthy voices
begged i have your alms adieu


third citizen

but this is something odd


second citizen

an twere to give again but tis no matter
exeunt the three citizens
re-enter two other citizens


coriolanus

pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your
voices that i may be consul i have here the
customary gown


fourth citizen

you have deserved nobly of your country and you
have not deserved nobly


coriolanus

your enigma


fourth citizen

you have been a scourge to her enemies you have
been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved
the common people


coriolanus

you should account me the more virtuous that i have
not been common in my love i will sir flatter my
sworn brother the people to earn a dearer
estimation of them tis a condition they account
gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is
rather to have my hat than my heart i will practise
the insinuating nod and be off to them most
counterfeitly that is sir i will counterfeit the
bewitchment of some popular man and give it
bountiful to the desirers therefore beseech you
i may be consul


fifth citizen

we hope to find you our friend and therefore give
you our voices heartily


fourth citizen

you have received many wounds for your country


coriolanus

i will not seal your knowledge with showing them i
will make much of your voices and so trouble you no further


both citizens

the gods give you joy sir heartily
exeunt


coriolanus

most sweet voices
better it is to die better to starve
than crave the hire which first we do deserve
why in this woolvish toge should i stand here
to beg of hob and dick that do appear
their needless vouches custom calls me tot
what custom wills in all things should we dot
the dust on antique time would lie unswept
and mountainous error be too highly heapt
for truth to oer-peer rather than fool it so
let the high office and the honour go
to one that would do thus i am half through
the one part suffer the other will i do
re-enter three citizens more
here come more voices
your voices for your voices i have fought
watch for your voices for your voices bear
of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six
i have seen and heard of for your voices have
done many things some less some more your voices
indeed i would be consul


sixth citizen

he has done nobly and cannot go without any honest
man voice


seventh citizen

therefore let him be consul the gods give him joy
and make him good friend to the people


all citizens

amen amen god save thee noble consul
exeunt


coriolanus

worthy voices
re-enter menenius with brutus and sicinius


menenius

you have stood your limitation and the tribunes
endue you with the people voice remains
that in the official marks invested you
anon do meet the senate


coriolanus

is this done


sicinius

the custom of request you have discharged
the people do admit you and are summon
to meet anon upon your approbation


coriolanus

where at the senate-house


sicinius

there coriolanus


coriolanus

may i change these garments


sicinius

you may sir


coriolanus

that ill straight do and knowing myself again
repair to the senate-house


menenius

ill keep you company will you along


brutus

we stay here for the people


sicinius

fare you well
exeunt coriolanus and menenius
he has it now and by his looks methink
tis warm at  heart


brutus

with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds
will you dismiss the people
re-enter citizens


sicinius

how now my masters have you chose this man


first citizen

he has our voices sir


brutus

we pray the gods he may deserve your loves


second citizen

amen sir to my poor unworthy notice
he mock us when he begg our voices


third citizen

certainly
he flouted us downright


first citizen

notis his kind of speech he did not mock us


second citizen

not one amongst us save yourself but says
he used us scornfully he should have show us
his marks of merit wounds received for country


sicinius

why so he did i am sure


citizens

no no no man saw em


third citizen

he said he had wounds which he could show
in private
and with his hat thus waving it in scorn
i would be consul says he aged custom
but by your voices will not so permit me
your voices therefore when we granted that
here was i thank you for your voices thank you
your most sweet voices now you have left
your voices
i have no further with you was not this mockery


sicinius

why either were you ignorant to seet
or seeing it of such childish friendliness
to yield your voices


brutus

could you not have told him
as you were lesson when he had no power
but was a petty servant to the state
he was your enemy ever spake against
your liberties and the charters that you bear
i the body of the weal and now arriving
a place of potency and sway o the state
if he should still malignantly remain
fast foe to the plebeii your voices might
be curses to yourselves you should have said
that as his worthy deeds did claim no less
than what he stood for so his gracious nature
would think upon you for your voices and
translate his malice towards you into love
standing your friendly lord


sicinius

thus to have said
as you were fore-advised had touch his spirit
and tried his inclination from him pluck
either his gracious promise which you might
as cause had call you up have held him to
or else it would have gall his surly nature
which easily endures not article
tying him to aught so putting him to rage
you should have taen the advantage of his choler
and pass him unelected


brutus

did you perceive
he did solicit you in free contempt
when he did need your loves and do you think
that his contempt shall not be bruising to you
when he hath power to crush why had your bodies
no heart among you or had you tongues to cry
against the rectorship of judgment


sicinius

have you
ere now denied the asker and now again
of him that did not ask but mock bestow
your sued-for tongues


third citizen

he not confirm we may deny him yet


second citizen

and will deny him
ill have five hundred voices of that sound


first citizen

i twice five hundred and their friends to piece em


brutus

get you hence instantly and tell those friends
they have chose a consul that will from them take
their liberties make them of no more voice
than dogs that are as often beat for barking
as therefore kept to do so


sicinius

let them assemble
and on a safer judgment all revoke
your ignorant election enforce his pride
and his old hate unto you besides forget not
with what contempt he wore the humble weed
how in his suit he scorn you but your loves
thinking upon his services took from you
the apprehension of his present portance
which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion
after the inveterate hate he bears you


brutus

lay
a fault on us your tribunes that we laboured
no impediment between but that you must
cast your election on him


sicinius

say you chose him
more after our commandment than as guided
by your own true affections and that your minds
preoccupied with what you rather must do
than what you should made you against the grain
to voice him consul lay the fault on us


brutus

ay spare us not say we read lectures to you
how youngly he began to serve his country
how long continued and what stock he springs of
the noble house o the marcians from whence came
that ancus marcius numa daughter son
who after great hostilius here was king
of the same house publius and quintus were
that our beat water brought by conduits hither
and  censorinus  nobly named so
twice being  by the people chosen  censor
was his great ancestor


sicinius

one thus descended
that hath beside well in his person wrought
to be set high in place we did commend
to your remembrances but you have found
scaling his present bearing with his past
that he your fixed enemy and revoke
your sudden approbation


brutus

say you neer had donet 
harp on that still but by our putting on
and presently when you have drawn your number
repair to the capitol


all

we will so almost all
repent in their election
exeunt citizens


brutus

let them go on
this mutiny were better put in hazard
than stay past doubt for greater
if as his nature is he fall in rage
with their refusal both observe and answer
the vantage of his anger


sicinius

to the capitol come
we will be there before the stream o the people
and this shall seem as partly tis their own
which we have goaded onward
exeunt

act iii
scene i rome a street

cornets enter coriolanus menenius all the gentry cominius titus lartius and other senators


coriolanus

tullus aufidius then had made new head


lartius

he had my lord and that it was which caused
our swifter composition


coriolanus

so then the volsces stand but as at first
ready when time shall prompt them to make road
upon again


cominius

they are worn lord consul so
that we shall hardly in our ages see
their banners wave again


coriolanus

saw you aufidius


lartius

on safe-guard he  came to me and did curse
against the volsces for they had so vilely
yielded the town he is retired to antium


coriolanus

spoke he of me


lartius

he did my lord


coriolanus

how what


lartius

how often he had met you sword to sword
that of all things upon the earth he hated
your person most that he would pawn his fortunes
to hopeless restitution so he might
be call your vanquisher


coriolanus

at antium lives he


lartius

at antium


coriolanus

i wish i had a cause to seek him there
to oppose his hatred fully welcome home
enter sicinius and brutus
behold these are the tribunes of the people
the tongues o the common mouth i do despise them
for they do prank them in authority
against all noble sufferance


sicinius

pass no further


coriolanus

ha what is that


brutus

it will be dangerous to go on no further


coriolanus

what makes this change


menenius

the matter


cominius

hath he not pass the noble and the common


brutus

cominius no


coriolanus

have i had children voices


first senator

tribunes give way he shall to the market-place


brutus

the people are incensed against him


sicinius

stop
or all will fall in broil


coriolanus

are these your herd
must these have voices that can yield them now
and straight disclaim their tongues what are
your offices
you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth
have you not set them on


menenius

be calm be calm


coriolanus

it is a purposed thing and grows by plot
to curb the will of the nobility
suffert and live with such as cannot rule
nor ever will be ruled


brutus

callt not a plot
the people cry you mock them and of late
when corn was given them gratis you repined
scandal the suppliants for the people call them
time-pleasers flatterers foes to nobleness


coriolanus

why this was known before


brutus

not to them all


coriolanus

have you inform them sithence


brutus

how i inform them


coriolanus

you are like to do such business


brutus

not unlike
each way to better yours


coriolanus

why then should i be consul by yond clouds
let me deserve so ill as you and make me
your fellow tribune


sicinius

you show too much of that
for which the people stir if you will pass
to where you are bound you must inquire your way
which you are out of with a gentler spirit
or never be so noble as a consul
nor yoke with him for tribune


menenius

let be calm


cominius

the people are abused set on this paltering
becomes not rome nor has coriolanus
deserved this so dishonour rub laid falsely
i the plain way of his merit


coriolanus

tell me of corn
this was my speech and i will speakt again 


menenius

not now not now


first senator

not in this heat sir now


coriolanus

now as i live i will my nobler friends
i crave their pardons
for the mutable rank-scented many let them
regard me as i do not flatter and
therein behold themselves i say again
in soothing them we nourish gainst our senate
the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition
which we ourselves have plough for sow
and scatter
by mingling them with us the honour number
who lack not virtue no nor power but that
which they have given to beggars


menenius

well no more


first senator

no more words we beseech you


coriolanus

how no more
as for my country i have shed my blood
not fearing outward force so shall my lungs
coin words till their decay against those measles
which we disdain should tatter us yet sought
the very way to catch them


brutus

you speak o the people
as if you were a god to punish not
a man of their infirmity


sicinius

twere well
we let the people knowt


menenius

what what his choler


coriolanus

choler
were i as patient as the midnight sleep
by jove twould be my mind


sicinius

it is a mind
that shall remain a poison where it is
not poison any further


coriolanus

shall remain
hear you this triton of the minnows mark you
his absolute hall


cominius

twas from the canon


coriolanus

hall
o good but most unwise patricians why
you grave but reckless senators have you thus
given hydra here to choose an officer
that with his peremptory hall being but
the horn and noise o the monster wants not spirit
to say hell turn your current in a ditch
and make your channel his if he have power
then vail your ignorance if none awake
your dangerous lenity if you are learn
be not as common fools if you are not
let them have cushions by you you are plebeians
if they be senators and they are no less
when both your voices blended the great taste
most palates theirs they choose their magistrate
and such a one as he who puts his hall
his popular hall against a graver bench
than ever frown in greece by jove himself
it makes the consuls base and my soul aches
to know when two authorities are up
neither supreme how soon confusion
may enter twixt the gap of both and take
the one by the other


cominius

well on to the market-place


coriolanus

whoever gave that counsel to give forth
the corn o the storehouse gratis as twas used
sometime in greece 


menenius

well well no more of that


coriolanus

though there the people had more absolute power
i say they nourish disobedience fed
the ruin of the state


brutus

why shall the people give
one that speaks thus their voice


coriolanus

ill give my reasons
more worthier than their voices they know the corn
was not our recompense resting well assured
that neer did service fort being press to the war
even when the navel of the state was touch
they would not thread the gates this kind of service
did not deserve corn gratis being i the war
their mutinies and revolts wherein they show
most valour spoke not for them the accusation
which they have often made against the senate
all cause unborn could never be the motive
of our so frank donation well what then
how shall this bisson multitude digest
the senate courtesy let deeds express
what like to be their words we did request it
we are the greater poll and in true fear
they gave us our demands thus we debase
the nature of our seats and make the rabble
call our cares fears which will in time
break ope the locks o the senate and bring in
the crows to peck the eagles


menenius

come enough


brutus

enough with over-measure


coriolanus

no take more
what may be sworn by both divine and human
seal what i end withal this double worship
where one part does disdain with cause the other
insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom
cannot conclude but by the yea and no
of general ignorance it must omit
real necessities and give way the while
to unstable slightness purpose so barr
it follows
nothing is done to purpose therefore beseech you 
you that will be less fearful than discreet
that love the fundamental part of state
more than you doubt the change ont that prefer
a noble life before a long and wish
to jump a body with a dangerous physic
that sure of death without it at once pluck out
the multitudinous tongue let them not lick
the sweet which is their poison your dishonour
mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
of that integrity which should becomet
not having the power to do the good it would
for the in which doth controlt


brutus

has said enough


sicinius

has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
as traitors do


coriolanus

thou wretch despite oerwhelm thee
what should the people do with these bald tribunes
on whom depending their obedience fails
to the greater bench in a rebellion
when what not meet but what must be was law
then were they chosen in a better hour
let what is meet be said it must be meet
and throw their power i the dust


brutus

manifest treason


sicinius

this a consul no


brutus

the aediles ho
enter an aedile
let him be apprehended


sicinius

go call the people
exit aedile
in whose name myself
attach thee as a traitorous innovator
a foe to the public weal obey i charge thee
and follow to thine answer


coriolanus

hence old goat
senators   cwell surety him


cominius

aged sir hands off


coriolanus

hence rotten thing or i shall shake thy bones
out of thy garments


sicinius

help ye citizens
enter a rabble of citizens plebeians with the aediles


menenius

on both sides more respect


sicinius

here he that would take from you all your power


brutus

citizens

senators   cweapons weapons weapons
they all bustle about coriolanus crying
tribunes patricians citizens what ho
icinius brutus coriolanus citizens

menenius

what is about to be i am out of breath
confusion near i cannot speak you tribunes
to the people coriolanus patience
speak good sicinius


sicinius

hear me people peace


citizens

let hear our tribune peace speak speak speak


sicinius

you are at point to lose your liberties
marcius would have all from you marcius
whom late you have named for consul


menenius

fie fie fie
this is the way to kindle not to quench


first senator

to unbuild the city and to lay all flat


sicinius

what is the city but the people


citizens

true
the people are the city


brutus

by the consent of all we were establish
the people magistrates


citizens

you so remain


menenius

and so are like to do


cominius

that is the way to lay the city flat
to bring the roof to the foundation
and bury all which yet distinctly ranges
in heaps and piles of ruin


sicinius

this deserves death


brutus

or let us stand to our authority
or let us lose it we do here pronounce
upon the part o the people in whose power
we were elected theirs marcius is worthy
of present death


sicinius

therefore lay hold of him
bear him to the rock tarpeian and from thence
into destruction cast him


brutus

aediles seize him


citizens

yield marcius yield


menenius

hear me one word
beseech you tribunes hear me but a word


aedile

peace peace


menenius

to brutus  be that you seem truly your
country friend
and temperately proceed to what you would
thus violently redress


brutus

sir those cold ways
that seem like prudent helps are very poisonous
where the disease is violent lay hands upon him
and bear him to the rock


coriolanus

no ill die here
drawing his sword
there some among you have beheld me fighting
come try upon yourselves what you have seen me


menenius

down with that sword tribunes withdraw awhile


brutus

lay hands upon him


cominius

help marcius help
you that be noble help him young and old


citizens

down with him down with him
in this mutiny the tribunes the aediles and the people are beat in


menenius

go get you to your house be gone away
all will be naught else


second senator

get you gone


cominius

stand fast
we have as many friends as enemies


menenius

sham it be put to that


first senator

the gods forbid
i prithee noble friend home to thy house
leave us to cure this cause


menenius

for tis a sore upon us
you cannot tent yourself be gone beseech you


cominius

come sir along with us


coriolanus

i would they were barbarians as they are
though in rome litter not romans as they are not
though calved i the porch o the capitol 


menenius

be gone
put not your worthy rage into your tongue
one time will owe another


coriolanus

on fair ground
i could beat forty of them


cominius

i could myself
take up a brace o the best of them yea the
two tribunes
but now tis odds beyond arithmetic
and manhood is call foolery when it stands
against a falling fabric will you hence
before the tag return whose rage doth rend
like interrupted waters and oerbear
what they are used to bear


menenius

pray you be gone
ill try whether my old wit be in request
with those that have but little this must be patch
with cloth of any colour


cominius

nay come away
exeunt coriolanus cominius and others


a patrician

this man has marr his fortune


menenius

his nature is too noble for the world
he would not flatter neptune for his trident
or jove for power to thunder his heart his mouth
what his breast forges that his tongue must vent
and being angry does forget that ever
he heard the name of death
a noise within
here goodly work


second patrician

i would they were abed


menenius

i would they were in tiber what the vengeance
could he not speak em fair
re-enter brutus and sicinius with the rabble


sicinius

where is this viper
that would depopulate the city and
be every man himself


menenius

you worthy tribunes 


sicinius

he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock
with rigorous hands he hath resisted law
and therefore law shall scorn him further trial
than the severity of the public power
which he so sets at nought


first citizen

he shall well know
the noble tribunes are the people mouths
and we their hands


citizens

he shall sure ont


menenius

sir sir 


sicinius

peace


menenius

do not cry havoc where you should but hunt
with modest warrant


sicinius

sir how comest that you
have holp to make this rescue


menenius

hear me speak
as i do know the consul worthiness
so can i name his faults 


sicinius

consul what consul


menenius

the consul coriolanus


brutus

he consul


citizens

no no no no no


menenius

if by the tribunes leave and yours good people
i may be heard i would crave a word or two
the which shall turn you to no further harm
than so much loss of time


sicinius

speak briefly then
for we are peremptory to dispatch
this viperous traitor to eject him hence
were but one danger and to keep him here
our certain death therefore it is decreed
he dies to-night


menenius

now the good gods forbid
that our renowned rome whose gratitude
towards her deserved children is enroll
in jove own book like an unnatural dam
should now eat up her own


sicinius

he a disease that must be cut away


menenius

o he a limb that has but a disease
mortal to cut it off to cure it easy
what has he done to rome that worthy death
killing our enemies the blood he hath lost 
which i dare vouch is more than that he hath
by many an ounce he dropp it for his country
and what is left to lose it by his country
were to us all that dot and suffer it
a brand to the end o the world


sicinius

this is clean kam


brutus

merely awry when he did love his country
it honour him


menenius

the service of the foot
being once gangrened is not then respected
for what before it was


brutus

well hear no more
pursue him to his house and pluck him thence
lest his infection being of catching nature
spread further


menenius

one word more one word
this tiger-footed rage when it shall find
the harm of unscann swiftness will too late
tie leaden pounds to heels proceed by process
lest parties as he is beloved break out
and sack great rome with romans


brutus

if it were so 


sicinius

what do ye talk
have we not had a taste of his obedience
our aediles smote ourselves resisted come


menenius

consider this he has been bred i the wars
since he could draw a sword and is ill school
in bolted language meal and bran together
he throws without distinction give me leave
ill go to him and undertake to bring him
where he shall answer by a lawful form
in peace to his utmost peril


first senator

noble tribunes
it is the humane way the other course
will prove too bloody and the end of it
unknown to the beginning


sicinius

noble menenius
be you then as the people officer
masters lay down your weapons


brutus

go not home


sicinius

meet on the market-place well attend you there
where if you bring not marcius well proceed
in our first way


menenius

ill bring him to you
to the senators
let me desire your company he must come
or what is worst will follow


first senator

pray you let to him
exeunt

scene ii a room in coriolanus house

enter coriolanus with patricians


coriolanus

let them puff all about mine ears present me
death on the wheel or at wild horses heels
or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock
that the precipitation might down stretch
below the beam of sight yet will i still
be thus to them


a patrician

you do the nobler


coriolanus

i muse my mother
does not approve me further who was wont
to call them woollen vassals things created
to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads
in congregations to yawn be still and wonder
when one but of my ordinance stood up
to speak of peace or war
enter volumnia
i talk of you
why did you wish me milder would you have me
false to my nature rather say i play
the man i am


volumnia

o sir sir sir
i would have had you put your power well on
before you had worn it out


coriolanus

let go


volumnia

you might have been enough the man you are
with striving less to be so lesser had been
the thwartings of your dispositions if
you had not show them how ye were disposed
ere they lack power to cross you


coriolanus

let them hang


a patrician

ay and burn too
enter menenius and senators


menenius

come come you have been too rough something
too rough
you must return and mend it


first senator

there no remedy
unless by not so doing our good city
cleave in the midst and perish


volumnia

pray be counsell
i have a heart as little apt as yours
but yet a brain that leads my use of anger
to better vantage


menenius

well said noble woman
before he should thus stoop to the herd but that
the violent fit o the time craves it as physic
for the whole state i would put mine armour on
which i can scarcely bear


coriolanus

what must i do


menenius

return to the tribunes


coriolanus

well what then what then


menenius

repent what you have spoke


coriolanus

for them i cannot do it to the gods
must i then dot to them


volumnia

you are too absolute
though therein you can never be too noble
but when extremities speak i have heard you say
honour and policy like unsever friends
i the war do grow together grant that and tell me
in peace what each of them by the other lose
that they combine not there


coriolanus

tush tush


menenius

a good demand


volumnia

if it be honour in your wars to seem
the same you are not which for your best ends
you adopt your policy how is it less or worse
that it shall hold companionship in peace
with honour as in war since that to both
it stands in like request


coriolanus

why force you this


volumnia

because that now it lies you on to speak
to the people not by your own instruction
nor by the matter which your heart prompts you
but with such words that are but rooted in
your tongue though but bastards and syllables
of no allowance to your bosom truth
now this no more dishonours you at all
than to take in a town with gentle words
which else would put you to your fortune and
the hazard of much blood
i would dissemble with my nature where
my fortunes and my friends at stake required
i should do so in honour i am in this
your wife your son these senators the nobles
and you will rather show our general louts
how you can frown than spend a fawn upon em
for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
of what that want might ruin


menenius

noble lady
come go with us speak fair you may salve so
not what is dangerous present but the loss
of what is past


volumnia

i prithee now my son
go to them with this bonnet in thy hand
and thus far having stretch it here be with them 
thy knee bussing the stones for in such business
action is eloquence and the eyes of the ignorant
more learned than the ears waving thy head
which often thus correcting thy stout heart
now humble as the ripest mulberry
that will not hold the handling or say to them
thou art their soldier and being bred in broils
hast not the soft way which thou dost confess
were fit for thee to use as they to claim
in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame
thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far
as thou hast power and person


menenius

this but done
even as she speaks why their hearts were yours
for they have pardons being ask as free
as words to little purpose


volumnia

prithee now
go and be ruled although i know thou hadst rather
follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
than flatter him in a bower here is cominius
enter cominius


cominius

i have been i the market-place and sirtis fit
you make strong party or defend yourself
by calmness or by absence all in anger


menenius

only fair speech


cominius

i think twill serve if he
can thereto frame his spirit


volumnia

he must and will
prithee now say you will and go about it


coriolanus

must i go show them my unbarbed sconce
must i with base tongue give my noble heart
a lie that it must bear well i will dot
yet were there but this single plot to lose
this mould of marcius they to dust should grind it
and throwt against the wind to the market-place
you have put me now to such a part which never
i shall discharge to the life


cominius

come come well prompt you


volumnia

i prithee now sweet son as thou hast said
my praises made thee first a soldier so
to have my praise for this perform a part
thou hast not done before


coriolanus

well i must dot
away my disposition and possess me
some harlot spirit my throat of war be turn
which quired with my drum into a pipe
small as an eunuch or the virgin voice
that babies lulls asleep the smiles of knaves
tent in my cheeks and schoolboys tears take up
the glasses of my sight a beggar tongue
make motion through my lips and my arm knees
who bow but in my stirrup bend like his
that hath received an alms i will not dot
lest i surcease to honour mine own truth
and by my body action teach my mind
a most inherent baseness


volumnia

at thy choice then
to beg of thee it is my more dishonour
than thou of them come all to ruin let
thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
thy dangerous stoutness for i mock at death
with as big heart as thou do as thou list
thy valiantness was mine thou suckst it from me
but owe thy pride thyself


coriolanus

pray be content
mother i am going to the market-place
chide me no more ill mountebank their loves
cog their hearts from them and come home beloved
of all the trades in rome look i am going
commend me to my wife ill return consul
or never trust to what my tongue can do
i the way of flattery further


volumnia

do your will
exit


cominius

away the tribunes do attend you arm yourself
to answer mildly for they are prepared
with accusations as i hear more strong
than are upon you yet


coriolanus

the word is mildly pray you let us go
let them accuse me by invention i
will answer in mine honour


menenius

ay but mildly


coriolanus

well mildly be it then mildly

set down by the poll


aedile

i have tis ready


sicinius

have you collected them by tribes


aedile

i have


sicinius

assemble presently the people hither
and when they bear me say it shall be so
i the right and strength o the commons be it either
for death for fine or banishment then let them
if i say fine cry fine if death cry eath
insisting on the old prerogative
and power i the truth o the cause


aedile

i shall inform them


brutus

and when such time they have begun to cry
let them not cease but with a din confused
enforce the present execution
of what we chance to sentence


aedile

very well


sicinius

make them be strong and ready for this hint
when we shall hap to give t them


brutus

go about it
exit aedile
put him to choler straight he hath been used
ever to conquer and to have his worth
of contradiction being once chafed he cannot

sicinius

well here he comes
enter coriolanus menenius and cominius with senators and patricians


menenius

coriolanus

ay as an ostler that for the poorest piece
will bear the knave by the volume the honour gods
keep rome in safety and the chairs of justice
supplied with worthy men plant love among 
throng our large temples with the shows of peace
and not our streets with war


first senator

amen amen


menenius

re-enter aedile with citizens


sicinius

aedile

list to your tribunes audience peace i say


coriolanus

first hear me speak


both tribunes

well say peace ho


coriolanus

shall i be charged no further than this present
must all determine here


sicinius

i do demand
if you submit you to the people voices
allow their officers and are content
to suffer lawful censure for such faults
as shall be proved upon you


coriolanus

i am content


menenius

lo citizens he says he is content
the warlike service he has done consider think
upon the wounds his body bears which show
like graves i the holy churchyard


coriolanus

scratches with briers
scars to move laughter only


menenius

consider further
that when he speaks not like a citizen
you find him like a soldier do not take
his rougher accents for malicious sounds
but as i say such as become a soldier
rather than envy you


cominius

well well no more


coriolanus

what is the matter
that being pass for consul with full voice
i am so dishonour that the very hour
you take it off again


sicinius

answer to us


coriolanus

say then tis true i ought so


sicinius

we charge you that you have contrived to take
from rome all season office and to wind
yourself into a power tyrannical
for which you are a traitor to the people


coriolanus

how traitor


menenius

nay temperately your promise


coriolanus

the fires i the lowest hell fold-in the people
call me their traitor thou injurious tribune
within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths
in thy hand clutch as many millions in
thy lying tongue both numbers i would say
thou liest unto thee with a voice as free
as i do pray the gods


sicinius

mark you this people


citizens

to the rock to the rock with him


sicinius

peace
we need not put new matter to his charge
what you have seen him do and heard him speak
beating your officers cursing yourselves
opposing laws with strokes and here defying
those whose great power must try him even this
so criminal and in such capital kind
deserves the extremest death


brutus

but since he hath
served well for rome 


coriolanus

what do you prate of service


brutus

i talk of that that know it


coriolanus

you


menenius

is this the promise that you made your mother


cominius

know i pray you 


coriolanus

i know no further
let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death
vagabond exile raying pent to linger
but with a grain a day i would not buy
their mercy at the price of one fair word
nor cheque my courage for what they can give
to havet with saying good morrow


sicinius

for that he has
as much as in him lies from time to time
envied against the people seeking means
to pluck away their power as now at last
given hostile strokes and that not in the presence
of dreaded justice but on the ministers
that do distribute it in the name o the people
and in the power of us the tribunes we
even from this instant banish him our city
in peril of precipitation
from off the rock tarpeian never more
to enter our rome gates i the people name
i say it shall be so


citizens

it shall be so it shall be so let him away
he banish and it shall be so


cominius

hear me my masters and my common friends 


sicinius

he sentenced no more hearing


cominius

let me speak
i have been consul and can show for rome
her enemies marks upon me i do love
my country good with a respect more tender
more holy and profound than mine own life
my dear wife estimate her womb increase
and treasure of my loins then if i would
speak that 


sicinius

we know your drift speak what


brutus

there no more to be said but he is banish
as enemy to the people and his country
it shall be so


citizens

it shall be so it shall be so


coriolanus

you common cry of curs whose breath i hate
as reek o the rotten fens whose loves i prize
as the dead carcasses of unburied men
that do corrupt my air i banish you
and here remain with your uncertainty
let every feeble rumour shake your hearts
your enemies with nodding of their plumes
fan you into despair have the power still
to banish your defenders till at length
your ignorance which finds not till it feels
making not reservation of yourselves
still your own foes deliver you as most
abated captives to some nation
that won you without blows despising
for you the city thus i turn my back
there is a world elsewhere

my surname coriolanus the painful service
the extreme dangers and the drops of blood
shed for my thankless country are requited
but with that surname a good memory
and witness of the malice and displeasure
which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains
the cruelty and envy of the people
permitted by our dastard nobles who
have all forsook me hath devour the rest
and suffer me by the voice of slaves to be
whoop out of rome now this extremity
hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope 
mistake me not to save my life for if
i had fear death of all the men i the world
i would have voided thee but in mere spite
to be full quit of those my banishers
stand i before thee here then if thou hast
a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge
thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
of shame seen through thy country speed
thee straight
and make my misery serve thy turn so use it
that my revengeful services may prove
as benefits to thee for i will fight
against my canker country with the spleen
of all the under fiends but if so be
thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
thourt tired then in a word i also am
longer to live most weary and present
my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice
which not to cut would show thee but a fool
since i have ever follow thee with hate
drawn tuns of blood out of thy country breast
and cannot live but to thy shame unless
it be to do thee service


aufidius

o marcius marcius
each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
a root of ancient envy if jupiter
should from yond cloud speak divine things
and say tis true ild not believe them more
than thee all noble marcius let me twine
mine arms about that body where against
my grained ash an hundred times hath broke
and scarr the moon with splinters here i clip
the anvil of my sword and do contest
as hotly and as nobly with thy love
as ever in ambitious strength i did
contend against thy valour know thou first
i loved the maid i married never man
sigh truer breath but that i see thee here
thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart
than when i first my wedded mistress saw
bestride my threshold why thou mars i tell thee
we have a power on foot and i had purpose
once more to hew thy target from thy brawn
or lose mine arm fort thou hast beat me out
twelve several times and i have nightly since
dreamt of encounters twixt thyself and me
we have been down together in my sleep
unbuckling helms fisting each other throat
and waked half dead with nothing worthy marcius
had we no quarrel else to rome but that
thou art thence banish we would muster all
from twelve to seventy and pouring war
into the bowels of ungrateful rome
like a bold flood oer-bear o come go in
and take our friendly senators by the hands
who now are here taking their leaves of me
who am prepared against your territories
though not for rome itself


coriolanus

you bless me gods


aufidius

therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have
the leading of thine own revenges take
the one half of my commission and set down 
as best thou art experienced since thou know
thy country strength and weakness thine own ways
whether to knock against the gates of rome
or rudely visit them in parts remote
to fright them ere destroy but come in
let me commend thee first to those that shall
say yea to thy desires a thousand welcomes
and more a friend than eer an enemy
yet marcius that was much your hand most welcome
exeunt coriolanus and aufidius the two servingmen come forward


first servingman

here a strange alteration


second servingman

by my hand i had thought to have strucken him with
a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
false report of him


first servingman

what an arm he has he turned me about with his
finger and his thumb as one would set up a top


second servingman

nay i knew by his face that there was something in
him he had sir a kind of face methought i
cannot tell how to term it


first servingman

he had so looking as it were would i were hanged
but i thought there was more in him than i could think


second servingman

so did i ill be sworn he is simply the rarest
man i the world


first servingman

i think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot on


second servingman

who my master


first servingman

nay it no matter for that


second servingman

worth six on him


first servingman

nay not so neither but i take him to be the
greater soldier


second servingman

faith look you one cannot tell how to say that
for the defence of a town our general is excellent


first servingman

ay and for an assault too
re-enter third servingman


third servingman

o slaves i can tell you news  news you rascals


first servingman

second servingman

what what what let partake


third servingman

i would not be a roman of all nations i had as
lieve be a condemned man


first servingman

second servingman

wherefore wherefore


third servingman

why here he that was wont to thwack our general
caius marcius


first servingman

why do you say thwack our general 


third servingman

i do not say thwack our general but he was always
good enough for him


second servingman

come we are fellows and friends he was ever too
hard for him i have heard him say so himself


first servingman

he was too hard for him directly to say the troth
ont before corioli he scotched him and notched
him like a carbon ado


second servingman

an he had been cannibally given he might have
broiled and eaten him too


first servingman

but more of thy news


third servingman

why he is so made on here within as if he were son
and heir to mars set at upper end o the table no
question asked him by any of the senators but they
stand bald before him our general himself makes a
mistress of him sanctifies himself with hand and
turns up the white o the eye to his discourse but
the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i
the middle and but one half of what he was
yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty
and grant of the whole table hell go he says
and sowl the porter of rome gates by the ears he
will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled


second servingman

and he as like to dot as any man i can imagine


third servingman

dot he will dot for look you sir he has as
many friends as enemies which friends sir as it
were durst not look you sir show themselves as
we term it his friends whilst he in directitude


first servingman

directitude what that


third servingman

but when they shall see sir his crest up again
and the man in blood they will out of their
burrows like conies after rain and revel all with
him


first servingman

but when goes this forward


third servingman

to-morrow to-day presently you shall have the
drum struck up this afternoon tis as it were a
parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they
wipe their lips


second servingman

why then we shall have a stirring world again
this peace is nothing but to rust iron increase
tailors and breed ballad-makers


first servingman

let me have war say i it exceeds peace as far as
day does night it spritely waking audible and
full of vent peace is a very apoplexy lethargy
mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more
bastard children than war a destroyer of men


second servingman

tis so and as war in some sort may be said to
be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a
great maker of cuckolds


first servingman

ay and it makes men hate one another


third servingman

reason because they then less need one another
the wars for my money i hope to see romans as cheap
as volscians they are rising they are rising

sicinius

we hear not of him neither need we fear him
his remedies are tame i the present peace
and quietness of the people which before
were in wild hurry here do we make his friends
blush that the world goes well who rather had
though they themselves did suffer byt behold
dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
our tradesmen with in their shops and going
about their functions friendly


brutus

we stood tot in good time
enter menenius
is this menenius


sicinius

both tribunes

hail sir


menenius

hail to you both


sicinius

your coriolanus

the commonwealth doth stand and so would do
were he more angry at it


menenius

all well and might have been much better if
he could have temporized


sicinius

where is he hear you


menenius

nay i hear nothing his mother and his wife
hear nothing from him
enter three or four citizens


citizens

the gods preserve you both


sicinius

god-den our neighbours


brutus

god-den to you all god-den to you all


first citizen

ourselves our wives and children on our knees
are bound to pray for you both


sicinius

live and thrive


brutus

farewell kind neighbours we wish coriolanus
had loved you as we did


citizens

now the gods keep you


both tribunes

farewell farewell
exeunt citizens


sicinius

this is a happier and more comely time
than when these fellows ran about the streets
crying confusion


brutus

caius marcius was
a worthy officer i the war but insolent
oercome with pride ambitious past all thinking
self-loving 


sicinius

and affecting one sole throne
without assistance


menenius

i think not so


sicinius

we should by this to all our lamentation
if he had gone forth consul found it so


brutus

the gods have well prevented it and rome
sits safe and still without him
enter an aedile


aedile

worthy tribunes
there is a slave whom we have put in prison
reports the volsces with two several powers
are enter in the roman territories
and with the deepest malice of the war
destroy what lies before em


menenius

tis aufidius
who hearing of our marcius banishment
thrusts forth his horns again into the world
which were inshell when marcius stood for rome
and durst not once peep out


sicinius

come what talk you
of marcius


brutus

go see this rumourer whipp it cannot be
the volsces dare break with us


menenius

cannot be
we have record that very well it can
and three examples of the like have been
within my age but reason with the fellow
before you punish him where he heard this
lest you shall chance to whip your information
and beat the messenger who bids beware
of what is to be dreaded


sicinius

tell not me
i know this cannot be


brutus

not possible
enter a messenger


messenger

the nobles in great earnestness are going
all to the senate-house some news is come
that turns their countenances


sicinius

tis this slave 
go whip him fore the people eyes his raising
nothing but his report


messenger

yes worthy sir
the slave report is seconded and more
more fearful is deliver


sicinius

what more fearful


messenger

it is spoke freely out of many mouths 
how probable i do not know that marcius
join with aufidius leads a power gainst rome
and vows revenge as spacious as between
the young and oldest thing


sicinius

this is most likely


brutus

raised only that the weaker sort may wish
good marcius home again


sicinius

the very trick ont


menenius

this is unlikely
he and aufidius can no more atone
than violentest contrariety
enter a second messenger


second messenger

you are sent for to the senate
a fearful army led by caius marcius
associated with aufidius rages
upon our territories and have already
oerborne their way consumed with fire and took
what lay before them
enter cominius


cominius

o you have made good work


menenius

what news what news


cominius

you have holp to ravish your own daughters and
to melt the city leads upon your pates
to see your wives dishonour to your noses 


menenius

what the news what the news


cominius

your temples burned in their cement and
your franchises whereon you stood confined
into an auger bore


menenius

pray now your news
you have made fair work i fear me pray your news 
if marcius should be join with volscians 


cominius

if
he is their god he leads them like a thing
made by some other deity than nature
that shapes man better and they follow him
against us brats with no less confidence
than boys pursuing summer butterflies
or butchers killing flies


menenius

you have made good work
you and your apron-men you that stood so up much
on the voice of occupation and
the breath of garlic-eaters


cominius

he will shake
your rome about your ears


menenius

as hercules
did shake down mellow fruit
you have made fair work


brutus

but is this true sir


cominius

ay and youll look pale
before you find it other all the regions
do smilingly revolt and who resist
are mock for valiant ignorance
and perish constant fools who ist can blame him
your enemies and his find something in him


menenius

we are all undone unless
the noble man have mercy


cominius

who shall ask it
the tribunes cannot dot for shame the people
deserve such pity of him as the wolf
does of the shepherds for his best friends if they
should say be good to rome they charged him even
as those should do that had deserved his hate
and therein show like enemies


menenius

tis true
if he were putting to my house the brand
that should consume it i have not the face
to say beseech you cease you have made fair hands
you and your crafts you have crafted fair


cominius

you have brought
a trembling upon rome such as was never
so incapable of help


both tribunes

say not we brought it


menenius

how was it we we loved him but like beasts
and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters
who did hoot him out o the city


cominius

but i fear
theyll roar him in again tullus aufidius
the second name of men obeys his points
as if he were his officer desperation
is all the policy strength and defence
that rome can make against them
enter a troop of citizens


menenius

here come the clusters
and is aufidius with him you are they
that made the air unwholesome when you cast
your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
coriolanus exile now he coming
and not a hair upon a soldier head
which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs
as you threw caps up will he tumble down
and pay you for your voices tis no matter
if he could burn us all into one coal
we have deserved it


citizens

faith we hear fearful news


first citizen

for mine own part
when i said banish him i said twas pity


second citizen

and so did i


third citizen

and so did i and to say the truth so did very
many of us that we did we did for the best and
though we willingly consented to his banishment yet
it was against our will


cominius

ye re goodly things you voices


menenius

you have made
good work you and your cry shall to the capitol


cominius

o ay what else
exeunt cominius and menenius


sicinius

go masters get you home be not dismay
these are a side that would be glad to have
this true which they so seem to fear go home
and show no sign of fear


first citizen

the gods be good to us come masters let home
i ever said we were i the wrong when we banished
him


second citizen

so did we all but come let home
exeunt citizens


brutus

i do not like this news

would buy this for a lie

pray let us go

scene vii a camp at a small distance from rome

enter aufidius and his lieutenant


aufidius

do they still fly to the roman


lieutenant

i do not know what witchcraft in him but
your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat
their talk at table and their thanks at end
and you are darken in this action sir
even by your own


aufidius

i cannot help it now
unless by using means i lame the foot
of our design he bears himself more proudlier
even to my person than i thought he would
when first i did embrace him yet his nature
in that no changeling and i must excuse
what cannot be amended


lieutenant

yet i wish sir 
i mean for your particular you had not
join in commission with him but either
had borne the action of yourself or else
to him had left it solely


aufidius

i understand thee well and be thou sure
when he shall come to his account he knows not
what i can urge against him although it seems
and so he thinks and is no less apparent
to the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly
and shows good husbandry for the volscian state
fights dragon-like and does achieve as soon
as draw his sword yet he hath left undone
that which shall break his neck or hazard mine
wheneer we come to our account


lieutenant

sir i beseech you think you hell carry rome


aufidius

all places yield to him ere he sits down
and the nobility of rome are his
the senators and patricians love him too
the tribunes are no soldiers and their people
will be as rash in the repeal as hasty
to expel him thence i think hell be to rome
as is the osprey to the fish who takes it
by sovereignty of nature first he was
a noble servant to them but he could not
carry his honours even whether twas pride
which out of daily fortune ever taints
the happy man whether defect of judgment
to fail in the disposing of those chances
which he was lord of or whether nature
not to be other than one thing not moving
from the casque to the cushion but commanding peace
even with the same austerity and garb
as he controll the war but one of these 
as he hath spices of them all not all
for i dare so far free him made him fear
so hated and so banish but he has a merit
to choke it in the utterance so our virtues
lie in the interpretation of the time
and power unto itself most commendable
hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
to extol what it hath done
one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail
rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail
come let away when caius rome is thine
thou art poor of all then shortly art thou mine
exeunt

act v
scene i rome a public place

enter menenius cominius sicinius brutus and others


menenius

no ill not go you hear what he hath said
which was sometime his general who loved him
in a most dear particular he call me father
but what o that go you that banish him
a mile before his tent fall down and knee
the way into his mercy nay if he coy
to hear cominius speak ill keep at home


cominius

he would not seem to know me


menenius

do you hear


cominius

yet one time he did call me by my name
i urged our old acquaintance and the drops
that we have bled together coriolanus
he would not answer to forbad all names
he was a kind of nothing titleless
till he had forged himself a name o the fire
of burning rome


menenius

why so you have made good work
a pair of tribunes that have rack for rome
to make coals cheap a noble memory


cominius

i minded him how royal twas to pardon
when it was less expected he replied
it was a bare petition of a state
to one whom they had punish


menenius

very well
could he say less


cominius

i offer to awaken his regard
for private friends his answer to me was
he could not stay to pick them in a pile
of noisome musty chaff he said twas folly
for one poor grain or two to leave unburnt
and still to nose the offence


menenius

for one poor grain or two
i am one of those his mother wife his child
and this brave fellow too we are the grains
you are the musty chaff and you are smelt
above the moon we must be burnt for you


sicinius

nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid
in this so never-needed help yet do not
upbraid with our distress but sure if you
would be your country pleader your good tongue
more than the instant army we can make
might stop our countryman


menenius

no ill not meddle


sicinius

pray you go to him


menenius

what should i do


brutus

only make trial what your love can do
for rome towards marcius


menenius

well and say that marcius
return me as cominius is return
unheard what then
but as a discontented friend grief-shot
with his unkindness sayt be so


sicinius

yet your good will
must have that thanks from rome after the measure
as you intended well


menenius

ill undertake t
i think hell hear me yet to bite his lip
and hum at good cominius much unhearts me
he was not taken well he had not dined
the veins unfill our blood is cold and then
we pout upon the morning are unapt
to give or to forgive but when we have stuff
these and these conveyances of our blood
with wine and feeding we have suppler souls
than in our priest-like fasts therefore ill watch him
till he be dieted to my request
and then ill set upon him


brutus

you know the very road into his kindness
and cannot lose your way


menenius

good faith ill prove him
speed how it will i shall ere long have knowledge
of my success
exit


cominius

hell never hear him


sicinius

not


cominius

i tell you he does sit in gold his eye
red as twould burn rome and his injury
the gaoler to his pity i kneel before him
twas very faintly he said rise dismiss me
thus with his speechless hand what he would do
he sent in writing after me what he would not
bound with an oath to yield to his conditions
so that all hope is vain
unless his noble mother and his wife
who as i hear mean to solicit him
for mercy to his country therefore let hence
and with our fair entreaties haste them on

scene ii entrance of the volscian camp before rome

two sentinels on guard
enter to them menenius


first senator

menenius

good my friends
if you have heard your general talk of rome
and of his friends there it is lots to blanks
my name hath touch your ears it is menenius


first senator

be it so go back the virtue of your name
is not here passable


menenius

i tell thee fellow
the general is my lover i have been
the book of his good acts whence men have read
his name unparallel haply amplified
for i have ever verified my friends
of whom he chief with all the size that verity
would without lapsing suffer nay sometimes
like to a bowl upon a subtle ground
i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise
have almost stamp the leasing therefore fellow
i must have leave to pass


first senator

faith sir if you had told as many lies in his
behalf as you have uttered words in your own you
should not pass here no though it were as virtuous
to lie as to live chastely therefore go back


menenius

prithee fellow remember my name is menenius
always factionary on the party of your general


second senator

howsoever you have been his liar as you say you
have i am one that telling true under him must
say you cannot pass therefore go back


menenius

has he dined canst thou tell for i would not
speak with him till after dinner


first senator

you are a roman are you


menenius

i am as thy general is


first senator

then you should hate rome as he does can you
when you have pushed out your gates the very
defender of them and in a violent popular
ignorance given your enemy your shield think to
front his revenges with the easy groans of old
women the virginal palms of your daughters or with
the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
you seem to be can you think to blow out the
intended fire your city is ready to flame in with
such weak breath as this no you are deceived
therefore back to rome and prepare for your
execution you are condemned our general has sworn
you out of reprieve and pardon


menenius

sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would
use me with estimation


second senator

come my captain knows you not


menenius

perceive that a jack guardant cannot office me from
my son coriolanus guess but by my entertainment
with him if thou standest not i the state of
hanging or of some death more long in
spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now

particular prosperity and love thee no worse than
thy old father menenius does o my son my son

water to quench it i was hardly moved to come to
thee but being assured none but myself could move
thee i have been blown out of your gates with
sighs and conjure thee to pardon rome and thy
petitionary countrymen the good gods assuage thy
wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet

access to thee

scene iii the tent of coriolanus

enter coriolanus aufidius and others


coriolanus

we will before the walls of rome tomorrow
set down our host my partner in this action
you must report to the volscian lords how plainly
i have borne this business


aufidius

only their ends
you have respected stopp your ears against
the general suit of rome never admitted
a private whisper no not with such friends
that thought them sure of you


coriolanus

this last old man
whom with a crack heart i have sent to rome
loved me above the measure of a father
nay godded me indeed their latest refuge
was to send him for whose old love i have
though i show sourly to him once more offer
the first conditions which they did refuse
and cannot now accept to grace him only
that thought he could do more a very little
i have yielded to fresh embassies and suits
nor from the state nor private friends hereafter
will i lend ear to ha what shout is this
shout within
shall i be tempted to infringe my vow
in the same time tis made i will not
enter in mourning habits virgilia volumnia leading young marcius valeria and attendants
my wife comes foremost then the honour mould
wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand
the grandchild to her blood but out affection
all bond and privilege of nature break
let it be virtuous to be obstinate
what is that curty worth or those doves eyes
which can make gods forsworn i melt and am not
of stronger earth than others my mother bows
as if olympus to a molehill should
in supplication nod and my young boy
hath an aspect of intercession which
great nature cries eny not let the volsces
plough rome and harrow italy ill never
be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand
as if a man were author of himself
and knew no other kin


virgilia

my lord and husband


coriolanus

these eyes are not the same i wore in rome


virgilia

the sorrow that delivers us thus changed
makes you think so


coriolanus

like a dull actor now
i have forgot my part and i am out
even to a full disgrace best of my flesh
forgive my tyranny but do not say
for that forgive our romans o a kiss
long as my exile sweet as my revenge
now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss
i carried from thee dear and my true lip
hath virgin it eer since you gods i prate
and the most noble mother of the world
leave unsaluted sink my knee i the earth
kneels
of thy deep duty more impression show
than that of common sons


volumnia

o stand up blest
whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
i kneel before thee and unproperly
show duty as mistaken all this while
between the child and parent
kneels


coriolanus

what is this
your knees to me to your corrected son
then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds
strike the proud cedars gainst the fiery sun
murdering impossibility to make
what cannot be slight work


volumnia

thou art my warrior
i holp to frame thee do you know this lady


coriolanus

the noble sister of publicola
the moon of rome chaste as the icicle
that curdied by the frost from purest snow
and hangs on dian temple dear valeria


volumnia

this is a poor epitome of yours
which by the interpretation of full time
may show like all yourself


coriolanus

the god of soldiers
with the consent of supreme jove inform
thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove
to shame unvulnerable and stick i the wars
like a great sea-mark standing every flaw
and saving those that eye thee


volumnia

your knee sirrah


coriolanus

that my brave boy


volumnia

even he your wife this lady and myself
are suitors to you


coriolanus

i beseech you peace
or if yould ask remember this before
the thing i have forsworn to grant may never
be held by you denials do not bid me
dismiss my soldiers or capitulate
again with rome mechanics tell me not
wherein i seem unnatural desire not
to ally my rages and revenges with
your colder reasons


volumnia

o no more no more
you have said you will not grant us any thing
for we have nothing else to ask but that
which you deny already yet we will ask
that if you fail in our request the blame
may hang upon your hardness therefore hear us


coriolanus

aufidius and you volsces mark for well
hear nought from rome in private your request


volumnia

should we be silent and not speak our raiment
and state of bodies would bewray what life
we have led since thy exile think with thyself
how more unfortunate than all living women
are we come hither since that thy sight
which should
make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance
with comforts
constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow
making the mother wife and child to see
the son the husband and the father tearing
his country bowels out and to poor we
thine enmity most capital thou barr us
our prayers to the gods which is a comfort
that all but we enjoy for how can we
alas how can we for our country pray
whereto we are bound together with thy victory
whereto we are bound alack or we must lose
the country our dear nurse or else thy person
our comfort in the country we must find
an evident calamity though we had
our wish which side should win for either thou
must as a foreign recreant be led
with manacles thorough our streets or else
triumphantly tread on thy country ruin
and bear the palm for having bravely shed
thy wife and children blood for myself son
i purpose not to wait on fortune till
these wars determine if i cannot persuade thee
rather to show a noble grace to both parts
than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner
march to assault thy country than to tread 
trust tot thou shalt not on thy mother womb
that brought thee to this world


virgilia

ay and mine
that brought you forth this boy to keep your name
living to time


young marcius

a shall not tread on me
ill run away till i am bigger but then ill fight


coriolanus

not of a woman tenderness to be
requires nor child nor woman face to see
i have sat too long
rising


volumnia

nay go not from us thus
if it were so that our request did tend
to save the romans thereby to destroy
the volsces whom you serve you might condemn us
as poisonous of your honour no our suit
is that you reconcile them while the volsces
may say this mercy we have show the romans
this we received and each in either side
give the all-hail to thee and cry be blest
for making up this peace thou know great son
the end of war uncertain but this certain
that if thou conquer rome the benefit
which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
whose repetition will be dogg with curses
whose chronicle thus writ the man was noble
but with his last attempt he wiped it out
destroy his country and his name remains
to the ensuing age abhorr speak to me son
thou hast affected the fine strains of honour
to imitate the graces of the gods
to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o the air
and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
that should but rive an oak why dost not speak
think thou it honourable for a noble man
still to remember wrongs daughter speak you
he cares not for your weeping speak thou boy
perhaps thy childishness will move him more
than can our reasons there no man in the world
more bound to  mother yet here he lets me prate
like one i the stocks thou hast never in thy life
show thy dear mother any courtesy
when she poor hen fond of no second brood
has cluck thee to the wars and safely home
loaden with honour say my request unjust
and spurn me back but if it be not so
thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee
that thou restrain from me the duty which
to a mother part belongs he turns away
down ladies let us shame him with our knees
to his surname coriolanus longs more pride
than pity to our prayers down an end
this is the last so we will home to rome
and die among our neighbours nay behold 
this boy that cannot tell what he would have
but kneels and holds up bands for fellowship
does reason our petition with more strength
than thou hast to deny t come let us go
this fellow had a volscian to his mother
his wife is in corioli and his child
like him by chance yet give us our dispatch
i am hush until our city be a-fire
and then ill speak a little
he holds her by the hand silent


coriolanus

o mother mother
what have you done behold the heavens do ope
the gods look down and this unnatural scene
they laugh at o my mother mother o
you have won a happy victory to rome
but for your son believe it o believe it
most dangerously you have with him prevail
if not most mortal to him but let it come
aufidius though i cannot make true wars
ill frame convenient peace now good aufidius
were you in my stead would you have heard
a mother less or granted less aufidius


aufidius

mine eyes to sweat compassion but good sir

moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before
his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with
his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a
battery he sits in his state as a thing made for
alexander what he bids be done is finished with
his bidding he wants nothing of a god but eternity
and a heaven to throne in


sicinius

yes mercy if you report him truly


menenius

mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy
in him than there is milk in a male tiger that
shall our poor city find and all this is long of

you wish us parties well deliver you
of your great danger


aufidius

sir i cannot tell
we must proceed as we do find the people


third conspirator

the people will remain uncertain whilst
twixt you there difference but the fall of either
makes the survivor heir of all


aufidius

i know it
and my pretext to strike at him admits
a good construction i raised him and i pawn
mine honour for his truth who being so heighten
he water his new plants with dews of flattery
seducing so my friends and to this end
he bow his nature never known before

third conspirator

in all his own desires nay let him choose
out of my files his projects to accomplish
my best and freshest men served his designments
in mine own person holp to reap the fame
which he did end all his and took some pride
to do myself this wrong till at the last
i seem his follower not partner and
he waged me with his countenance as if
i had been mercenary


first conspirator

and had no welcomes home but he returns
splitting the air with noise


second conspirator

and patient fools
whose children he hath slain their base throats tear
with giving him glory


third conspirator

ere he express himself or move the people
with what he would say let him feel your sword

his reasons with his body

that late he married hath referr herself
unto a poor but worthy gentleman she wedded
her husband banish she imprison all

be touch at very heart


second gentleman

first gentleman

he that hath lost her too so is the queen
that most desired the match but not a courtier
although they wear their faces to the bent
of the king look hath a heart that is not
glad at the thing they scowl at


second gentleman

and why so


first gentleman

he that hath miss the princess is a thing
too bad for bad report and he that hath her 
i mean that married her alack good man
and therefore banish is a creature such
as to seek through the regions of the earth
for one his like there would be something failing
in him that should compare i do not think
so fair an outward and such stuff within
endows a man but he


second gentleman

you speak him far


first gentleman

crush him together rather than unfold
his measure duly


second gentleman

what his name and birth


first gentleman

i cannot delve him to the root his father
was call sicilius who did join his honour
against the romans with cassibelan
but had his titles by tenantius whom
he served with glory and admired success
so gain the sur-addition leonatus
and had besides this gentleman in question
two other sons who in the wars o the time
died with their swords in hand for which
their father
then old and fond of issue took such sorrow
that he quit being and his gentle lady
big of this gentleman our theme deceased
as he was born the king he takes the babe
to his protection calls him posthumus leonatus
breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber
puts to him all the learnings that his time
could make him the receiver of which he took
as we do air fast as twas minister
and in spring became a harvest lived in court 
which rare it is to do most praised most loved
a sample to the youngest to the more mature
a glass that feated them and to the graver

second lord

first lord

not hurt it is a thoroughfare for steel if it be not hurt


second lord

aside  his steel was in debt it went o the
backside the town


cloten

the villain would not stand me


second lord

aside  no but he fled forward still toward your face


first lord

stand you you have land enough of your own but
he added to your having gave you some ground


second lord

aside  as many inches as you have oceans puppies


cloten

i would they had not come between us


second lord

aside  so would i till you had measured how long
a fool you were upon the ground

aside  she shines not upon fools lest the
reflection should hurt her

imogen

then waved his handkerchief


pisanio

and kiss it madam


imogen

senseless linen happier therein than i
and that was all


pisanio

no madam for so long
as he could make me with this eye or ear
distinguish him from others he did keep
the deck with glove or hat or handkerchief
still waving as the fits and stirs of  mind
could best express how slow his soul sail on
how swift his ship


imogen

thou shouldst have made him
as little as a crow or less ere left
to after-eye him


pisanio

madam so i did


imogen

i would have broke mine eye-strings crack them but
to look upon him till the diminution
of space had pointed him sharp as my needle
nay follow him till he had melted from
the smallness of a gnat to air and then
have turn mine eye and wept but good pisanio
when shall we hear from him


pisanio

be assured madam
with his next vantage


imogen

i did not take my leave of him but had
most pretty things to say ere i could tell him
how i would think on him at certain hours
such thoughts and such or i could make him swear
the shes of italy should not betray
mine interest and his honour or have charged him
at the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight
to encounter me with orisons for then
i am in heaven for him or ere i could
give him that parting kiss which i had set
betwixt two charming words comes in my father

scene iv rome philario house

enter philario iachimo a frenchman a dutchman and a spaniard


iachimo

believe it sir i have seen him in britain he was
then of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy
as since he hath been allowed the name of but i
could then have looked on him without the help of
admiration though the catalogue of his endowments
had been tabled by his side and i to peruse him by items


philario

you speak of him when he was less furnished than now
he is with that which makes him both without and within


frenchman

i have seen him in france we had very many there
could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he


iachimo

this matter of marrying his king daughter wherein
he must be weighed rather by her value than his own
words him i doubt not a great deal from the matter


frenchman

and then his banishment


iachimo

ay and the approbation of those that weep this
lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully
to extend him be it but to fortify her judgment
which else an easy battery might lay flat for
taking a beggar without less quality but how comes
it he is to sojourn with you how creeps
acquaintance


philario

his father and i were soldiers together to whom i
have been often bound for no less than my life
here comes the briton let him be so entertained
amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your
knowing to a stranger of his quality
enter posthumus leonatus
i beseech you all be better known to this
gentleman whom i commend to you as a noble friend
of mine how worthy he is i will leave to appear
hereafter rather than story him in his own hearing


frenchman

sir we have known together in orleans


posthumus leonatus

since when i have been debtor to you for courtesies
which i will be ever to pay and yet pay still


frenchman

sir you oer-rate my poor kindness i was glad i
did atone my countryman and you it had been pity
you should have been put together with so mortal a
purpose as then each bore upon importance of so
slight and trivial a nature


posthumus leonatus

by your pardon sir i was then a young traveller
rather shunned to go even with what i heard than in
my every action to be guided by others experiences
but upon my mended judgment if i offend not to say
it is mended my quarrel was not altogether slight


frenchman

faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords
and by such two that would by all likelihood have
confounded one the other or have fallen both


iachimo

can we with manners ask what was the difference


frenchman

safely i think twas a contention in public
which may without contradiction suffer the report
it was much like an argument that fell out last
night where each of us fell in praise of our
country mistresses this gentleman at that time
vouching and upon warrant of bloody
affirmation his to be more fair virtuous wise
chaste constant-qualified and less attemptable
than any the rarest of our ladies in france


iachimo

that lady is not now living or this gentleman
opinion by this worn out


posthumus leonatus

she holds her virtue still and i my mind


iachimo

you must not so far prefer her fore ours of italy


posthumus leonatus

being so far provoked as i was in france i would
abate her nothing though i profess myself her
adorer not her friend


iachimo

as fair and as good a kind of hand-in-hand
comparison had been something too fair and too good
for any lady in britain if she went before others
i have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres
many i have beheld i could not but believe she
excelled many but i have not seen the most
precious diamond that is nor you the lady


posthumus leonatus

i praised her as i rated her so do i my stone


iachimo

what do you esteem it at


posthumus leonatus

more than the world enjoys


iachimo

either your unparagoned mistress is dead or she
outprized by a trifle


posthumus leonatus

you are mistaken the one may be sold or given if
there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit
for the gift the other is not a thing for sale
and only the gift of the gods


iachimo

which the gods have given you


posthumus leonatus

which by their graces i will keep


iachimo

you may wear her in title yours but you know
strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds your
ring may be stolen too so your brace of unprizable
estimations the one is but frail and the other
casual a cunning thief or a that way accomplished
courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last


posthumus leonatus

your italy contains none so accomplished a courtier
to convince the honour of my mistress if in the
holding or loss of that you term her frail i do
nothing doubt you have store of thieves
notwithstanding i fear not my ring


philario

let us leave here gentlemen


posthumus leonatus

sir with all my heart this worthy signior i
thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first


iachimo

with five times so much conversation i should get
ground of your fair mistress make her go back even
to the yielding had i admittance and opportunity to friend


posthumus leonatus

no no


iachimo

i dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to
your ring which in my opinion oervalues it
something but i make my wager rather against your
confidence than her reputation and to bar your
offence herein too i durst attempt it against any
lady in the world


posthumus leonatus

you are a great deal abused in too bold a
persuasion and i doubt not you sustain what youre
worthy of by your attempt


iachimo

what that


posthumus leonatus

a repulse though your attempt as you call it
deserve more a punishment too


philario

gentlemen enough of this it came in too suddenly
let it die as it was born and i pray you be
better acquainted


iachimo

would i had put my estate and my neighbour on the
approbation of what i have spoke


posthumus leonatus

what lady would you choose to assail


iachimo

yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe
i will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring
that commend me to the court where your lady is
with no more advantage than the opportunity of a
second conference and i will bring from thence
that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved


posthumus leonatus

i will wage against your gold gold to it my ring
i hold dear as my finger tis part of it


iachimo

you are afraid and therein the wiser if you buy
ladies flesh at a million a dram you cannot
preserve it from tainting but i see you have some
religion in you that you fear


posthumus leonatus

this is but a custom in your tongue you bear a
graver purpose i hope


iachimo

i am the master of my speeches and would undergo
what spoken i swear


posthumus leonatus

will you i shall but lend my diamond till your
return let there be covenants drawn between my
mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your
unworthy thinking i dare you to this match here my ring


philario

i will have it no lay


iachimo

by the gods it is one if i bring you no
sufficient testimony that i have enjoyed the dearest
bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats
are yours so is your diamond too if i come off
and leave her in such honour as you have trust in
she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are
yours provided i have your commendation for my more
free entertainment


posthumus leonatus

i embrace these conditions let us have articles
betwixt us only thus far you shall answer if
you make your voyage upon her and give me directly
to understand you have prevailed i am no further
your enemy she is not worth our debate if she
remain unseduced you not making it appear
otherwise for your ill opinion and the assault you
have made to her chastity you shall answer me with
your sword


iachimo

your hand a covenant we will have these things set
down by lawful counsel and straight away for
britain lest the bargain should catch cold and
starve i will fetch my gold and have our two
wagers recorded


posthumus leonatus

agreed

first lady

i madam


queen

dispatch
exeunt ladies
now master doctor have you brought those drugs


cornelius

pleaseth your highness ay here they are madam
presenting a small box
but i beseech your grace without offence 
my conscience bids me ask wherefore you have
commanded of me those most poisonous compounds
which are the movers of a languishing death
but though slow deadly


queen

i wonder doctor
thou ask me such a question have i not been
thy pupil long hast thou not learn me how
to make perfumes distil preserve yea so
that our great king himself doth woo me oft
for my confections having thus far proceeded 
unless thou think me devilish ist not meet
that i did amplify my judgment in
other conclusions i will try the forces
of these thy compounds on such creatures as
we count not worth the hanging but none human
to try the vigour of them and apply
allayments to their act and by them gather
their several virtues and effects


cornelius

your highness
shall from this practise but make hard your heart
besides the seeing these effects will be
both noisome and infectious


queen

o content thee
enter pisanio
aside
here comes a flattering rascal upon him
will i first work he for his master
an enemy to my son how now pisanio
doctor your service for this time is ended
take your own way


cornelius

aside          i do suspect you madam
but you shall do no harm


queen

to pisanio            hark thee a word


cornelius

aside  i do not like her she doth think she has
strange lingering poisons i do know her spirit
and will not trust one of her malice with
a drug of such damn nature those she has
will stupefy and dull the sense awhile
which first perchance shell prove on
cats and dogs
then afterward up higher but there is
no danger in what show of death it makes
more than the locking-up the spirits a time
to be more fresh reviving she is fool
with a most false effect and i the truer
so to be false with her


queen

no further service doctor
until i send for thee


cornelius

i humbly take my leave
exit


queen

weeps she still say thou dost thou think in time
she will not quench and let instructions enter
where folly now possesses do thou work
when thou shalt bring me word she loves my son
ill tell thee on the instant thou art then
as great as is thy master greater for
his fortunes all lie speechless and his name
is at last gasp return he cannot nor
continue where he is to shift his being
is to exchange one misery with another
and every day that comes comes to decay
a day work in him what shalt thou expect
to be depender on a thing that leans
who cannot be new built nor has no friends
so much as but to prop him
the queen drops the box pisanio takes it up
thou takest up
thou know not what but take it for thy labour
it is a thing i made which hath the king
five times redeem from death i do not know
what is more cordial nay i prethee take it
it is an earnest of a further good
that i mean to thee tell thy mistress how
the case stands with her dot as from thyself
think what a chance thou changest on but think
thou hast thy mistress still to boot my son
who shall take notice of thee ill move the king
to any shape of thy preferment such
as thoult desire and then myself i chiefly
that set thee on to this desert am bound
to load thy merit richly call my women
think on my words
exit pisanio
a sly and constant knave
not to be shaked the agent for his master
and the remembrancer of her to hold
the hand-fast to her lord i have given him that
which if he take shall quite unpeople her
of liegers for her sweet and which she after
except she bend her humour shall be assured
to taste of too
re-enter pisanio and ladies

enter pisanio and iachimo


pisanio

madam a noble gentleman of rome
comes from my lord with letters


iachimo

change you madam
the worthy leonatus is in safety
and greets your highness dearly
presents a letter


imogen

thanks good sir
youre kindly welcome


iachimo

aside  all of her that is out of door most rich
if she be furnish with a mind so rare
she is alone the arabian bird and i
have lost the wager boldness be my friend
arm me audacity from head to foot
or like the parthian i shall flying fight
rather directly fly


imogen

reads  he is one of the noblest note to whose
kindnesses i am most infinitely tied reflect upon
him accordingly as you value your trust 
leonatus
so far i read aloud
but even the very middle of my heart
is warm by the rest and takes it thankfully
you are as welcome worthy sir as i
have words to bid you and shall find it so
in all that i can do


iachimo

thanks fairest lady
what are men mad hath nature given them eyes
to see this vaulted arch and the rich crop
of sea and land which can distinguish twixt
the fiery orbs above and the twinn stones
upon the number beach and can we not
partition make with spectacles so precious
twixt fair and foul


imogen

what makes your admiration


iachimo

it cannot be i the eye for apes and monkeys
twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
contemn with mows the other nor i the judgment
for idiots in this case of favour would
be wisely definite nor i the appetite
sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
should make desire vomit emptiness
not so allured to feed


imogen

what is the matter trow


iachimo

the cloyed will
that satiate yet unsatisfied desire that tub
both fill and running ravening first the lamb
longs after for the garbage


imogen

what dear sir
thus raps you are you well


iachimo

thanks madam well
to pisanio

pisanio

i was going sir
to give him welcome
exit


imogen

continues well my lord his health beseech you


iachimo

well madam


imogen

is he disposed to mirth i hope he is


iachimo

exceeding pleasant none a stranger there
so merry and so gamesome he is call
the briton reveller


imogen

when he was here
he did incline to sadness and oft-times
not knowing why


iachimo

i never saw him sad
there is a frenchman his companion one
an eminent monsieur that it seems much loves
a gallian girl at home he furnaces
the thick sighs from him whiles the jolly briton 
your lord i mean laughs from free lungs cries o
can my sides hold to think that man who knows
by history report or his own proof
what woman is yea what she cannot choose
but must be will his free hours languish for
assured bondage


imogen

will my lord say so


iachimo

ay madam with his eyes in flood with laughter
it is a recreation to be by
and hear him mock the frenchman but heavens know
some men are much to blame


imogen

not he i hope


iachimo

not he but yet heaven bounty towards him might
be used more thankfully in himself tis much
in you which i account his beyond all talents
whilst i am bound to wonder i am bound
to pity too


imogen

what do you pity sir


iachimo

two creatures heartily


imogen

am i one sir
you look on me what wreck discern you in me
deserves your pity


iachimo

lamentable what
to hide me from the radiant sun and solace
i the dungeon by a snuff


imogen

i pray you sir
deliver with more openness your answers
to my demands why do you pity me


iachimo

that others do 
i was about to say enjoy your but
it is an office of the gods to venge it
not mine to speak on t


imogen

you do seem to know
something of me or what concerns me pray you 
since doubling things go ill often hurts more
than to be sure they do for certainties
either are past remedies or timely knowing
the remedy then born discover to me
what both you spur and stop


iachimo

had i this cheek
to bathe my lips upon this hand whose touch
whose every touch would force the feeler soul
to the oath of loyalty this object which
takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye
fixing it only here should i damn then
slaver with lips as common as the stairs
that mount the capitol join gripes with hands
made hard with hourly falsehood falsehood as
with labour then by-peeping in an eye
base and unlustrous as the smoky light
that fed with stinking tallow it were fit
that all the plagues of hell should at one time
encounter such revolt


imogen

my lord i fear
has forgot britain


iachimo

and himself not i
inclined to this intelligence pronounce
the beggary of his change but tis your graces
that from pay mutest conscience to my tongue
charms this report out


imogen

let me hear no more


iachimo

o dearest soul your cause doth strike my heart
with pity that doth make me sick a lady
so fair and fasten to an empery
would make the great king double to be partner
with tomboys hired with that self-exhibition
which your own coffers yield with diseased ventures
that play with all infirmities for gold
which rottenness can lend nature such boil stuff
as well might poison poison be revenged
or she that bore you was no queen and you
recoil from your great stock


imogen

revenged
how should i be revenged if this be true 
as i have such a heart that both mine ears
must not in haste abuse if it be true
how should i be revenged


iachimo

should he make me
live like diana priest betwixt cold sheets
whiles he is vaulting variable ramps
in your despite upon your purse revenge it
i dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure
more noble than that runagate to your bed
and will continue fast to your affection
still close as sure


imogen

what ho pisanio


iachimo

let me my service tender on your lips


imogen

away i do condemn mine ears that have
so long attended thee if thou wert honourable
thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue not
for such an end thou seek as base as strange
thou wrong a gentleman who is as far
from thy report as thou from honour and
solicit here a lady that disdains
thee and the devil alike what ho pisanio
the king my father shall be made acquainted
of thy assault if he shall think it fit
a saucy stranger in his court to mart
as in a romish stew and to expound
his beastly mind to us he hath a court
he little cares for and a daughter who
he not respects at all what ho pisanio


iachimo

o happy leonatus i may say
the credit that thy lady hath of thee
deserves thy trust and thy most perfect goodness
her assured credit blessed live you long
a lady to the worthiest sir that ever
country call his and you his mistress only
for the most worthiest fit give me your pardon
i have spoke this to know if your affiance
were deeply rooted and shall make your lord
that which he is new oer and he is one
the truest manner such a holy witch
that he enchants societies into him
half all men hearts are his


imogen

you make amends


iachimo

he sits mongst men like a descended god
he hath a kind of honour sets him off
more than a mortal seeming be not angry
most mighty princess that i have adventured
to try your taking a false report which hath
honour with confirmation your great judgment
in the election of a sir so rare
which you know cannot err the love i bear him
made me to fan you thus but the gods made you
unlike all others chaffless pray your pardon


imogen

for yours


iachimo

to entreat your grace but in a small request
and yet of moment to for it concerns
your lord myself and other noble friends
are partners in the business

the best feather of our wing have mingled sums
to buy a present for the emperor

and i am something curious being strange
to have them in safe stowage may it please you

oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure


first lord

what got he by that you have broke his pate with
your bowl

lady

almost midnight madam

iachimo

the crickets sing and man oer-labour sense
repairs itself by rest our tarquin thus
did softly press the rushes ere he waken
the chastity he wounded cytherea
how bravely thou becomest thy bed fresh lily
and whiter than the sheets that i might touch
but kiss one kiss rubies unparagon
how dearly they dot tis her breathing that
perfumes the chamber thus the flame o the taper
bows toward her and would under-peep her lids
to see the enclosed lights now canopied
under these windows white and azure laced
with blue of heaven own tinct but my design
to note the chamber i will write all down
such and such pictures there the window such
the adornment of her bed the arras figures
why such and such and the contents o the story
ah but some natural notes about her body
above ten thousand meaner moveables
would testify to enrich mine inventory
o sleep thou ape of death lie dull upon her
and be her sense but as a monument
thus in a chapel lying come off come off
taking off her bracelet
as slippery as the gordian knot was hard
tis mine and this will witness outwardly
as strongly as the conscience does within
to the madding of her lord on her left breast
a mole cinque-spotted like the crimson drops
i the bottom of a cowslip here a voucher
stronger than ever law could make this secret
will force him think i have pick the lock and taen
the treasure of her honour no more to what end
why should i write this down that riveted
screw to my memory she hath been reading late
the tale of tereus here the leaf turn down
where philomel gave up i have enough
to the trunk again and shut the spring of it
swift swift you dragons of the night that dawning
may bare the raven eye i lodge in fear
though this a heavenly angel hell is here

song

on chaliced flowers that lies
and winking mary-buds begin
to ope their golden eyes
with every thing that pretty is
my lady sweet arise
arise arise


cloten

yet who than he more mean to knit their souls
on whom there is no more dependency
but brats and beggary in self-figured knot

the consequence o the crown and must not soil
the precious note of it with a base slave
a hilding for a livery a squire cloth
a pantler not so eminent


imogen

profane fellow
wert thou the son of jupiter and no more
but what thou art besides thou wert too base
to be his groom thou wert dignified enough

posthumus leonatus

fear it not sir i would i were so sure
to win the king as i am bold her honour
will remain hers


philario

what means do you make to him


posthumus leonatus

not any but abide the change of time
quake in the present winter state and wish
that warmer days would come in these sear hopes
i barely gratify your love they failing
i must die much your debtor


philario

your very goodness and your company
oerpays all i can do by this your king
hath heard of great augustus caius lucius
will do commission throughly and i think
hell grant the tribute send the arrearages
or look upon our romans whose remembrance
is yet fresh in their grief


posthumus leonatus

i do believe
statist though i am none nor like to be
that this will prove a war and you shall hear
the legions now in gallia sooner landed
in our not-fearing britain than have tidings
of any penny tribute paid our countrymen
are men more order than when julius caesar
smiled at their lack of skill but found
their courage
worthy his frowning at their discipline
now mingled with their courages will make known
to their approvers they are people such
that mend upon the world
enter iachimo


philario

see iachimo


posthumus leonatus

the swiftest harts have posted you by land
and winds of all the comers kiss your sails
to make your vessel nimble


philario

welcome sir


posthumus leonatus

i hope the briefness of your answer made
the speediness of your return


iachimo

your lady
is one of the fairest that i have look upon


posthumus leonatus

and therewithal the best or let her beauty
look through a casement to allure false hearts
and be false with them


iachimo

here are letters for you


posthumus leonatus

their tenor good i trust


iachimo

tis very like


philario

was caius lucius in the britain court
when you were there


iachimo

he was expected then
but not approach


posthumus leonatus

all is well yet
sparkles this stone as it was wont or ist not
too dull for your good wearing


iachimo

if i had lost it
i should have lost the worth of it in gold
ill make a journey twice as far to enjoy
a second night of such sweet shortness which
was mine in britain for the ring is won


posthumus leonatus

the stone too hard to come by


iachimo

not a whit
your lady being so easy


posthumus leonatus

make not sir
your loss your sport i hope you know that we
must not continue friends


iachimo

good sir we must
if you keep covenant had i not brought
the knowledge of your mistress home i grant
we were to question further but i now
profess myself the winner of her honour
together with your ring and not the wronger
of her or you having proceeded but
by both your wills


posthumus leonatus

if you can maket apparent
that you have tasted her in bed my hand
and ring is yours if not the foul opinion
you had of her pure honour gains or loses
your sword or mine or masterless leaves both
to who shall find them


iachimo

sir my circumstances
being so near the truth as i will make them
must first induce you to believe whose strength
i will confirm with oath which i doubt not
youll give me leave to spare when you shall find
you need it not


posthumus leonatus

proceed


iachimo

first her bedchamber 
where i confess i slept not but profess
had that was well worth watching it was hang
with tapesty of silk and silver the story
proud cleopatra when she met her roman
and cydnus swell above the banks or for
the press of boats or pride a piece of work
so bravely done so rich that it did strive
in workmanship and value which i wonder
could be so rarely and exactly wrought
since the true life ont was 


posthumus leonatus

this is true
and this you might have heard of here by me
or by some other


iachimo

more particulars
must justify my knowledge


posthumus leonatus

so they must
or do your honour injury


iachimo

the chimney
is south the chamber and the chimney-piece
chaste dian bathing never saw i figures
so likely to report themselves the cutter
was as another nature dumb outwent her
motion and breath left out


posthumus leonatus

this is a thing
which you might from relation likewise reap
being as it is much spoke of


iachimo

the roof o the chamber
with golden cherubins is fretted her andirons 
i had forgot them were two winking cupids
of silver each on one foot standing nicely
depending on their brands


posthumus leonatus

this is her honour
let it be granted you have seen all this and praise
be given to your remembrance the description
of what is in her chamber nothing saves
the wager you have laid


iachimo

then if you can
showing the bracelet
be pale i beg but leave to air this jewel see
and now tis up again it must be married
to that your diamond ill keep them


posthumus leonatus

jove
once more let me behold it is it that
which i left with her


iachimo

sir i thank her that
she stripp it from her arm i see her yet
her pretty action did outsell her gift
and yet enrich it too she gave it me and said
she prized it once


posthumus leonatus

may be she pluck it off
to send it me


iachimo

she writes so to you doth she


posthumus leonatus

o no no no tis true here take this too
gives the ring
it is a basilisk unto mine eye
kills me to look ont let there be no honour
where there is beauty truth where semblance love
where there another man the vows of women
of no more bondage be to where they are made
than they are to their virtues which is nothing
o above measure false


philario

have patience sir
and take your ring again tis not yet won
it may be probable she lost it or
who knows if one of her women being corrupted
hath stoln it from her


posthumus leonatus

very true
and so i hope he came byt back my ring
render to me some corporal sign about her
more evident than this for this was stolen


iachimo

by jupiter i had it from her arm


posthumus leonatus

hark you he swears by jupiter he swears
tis true nay keep the ring tis true i am sure
she would not lose it her attendants are
all sworn and honourable they induced to steal it
and by a stranger no he hath enjoyed her
the cognizance of her incontinency
is this she hath bought the name of whore
thus dearly
there take thy hire and all the fiends of hell
divide themselves between you


philario

sir be patient
this is not strong enough to be believed
of one persuaded well of 


posthumus leonatus

never talk ont
she hath been colted by him


iachimo

if you seek
for further satisfying under her breast 
worthy the pressing lies a mole right proud
of that most delicate lodging by my life
i kiss it and it gave me present hunger
to feed again though full you do remember
this stain upon her


posthumus leonatus

ay and it doth confirm
another stain as big as hell can hold
were there no more but it


iachimo

will you hear more


posthumus leonatus

spare your arithmetic never count the turns
once and a million


iachimo

ill be sworn 


posthumus leonatus

no swearing
if you will swear you have not donet you lie
and i will kill thee if thou dost deny
thou made me cuckold


iachimo

ill deny nothing


posthumus leonatus

o that i had her here to tear her limb-meal
i will go there and dot i the court before
her father ill do something 
exit


philario

quite besides
the government of patience you have won
let follow him and pervert the present wrath
he hath against himself

act iii
scene i britain a hall in cymbeline palace

enter in state cymbeline queen cloten  and lords at one door and at another caius lucius and attendants


cymbeline

now say what would augustus caesar with us


caius lucius

when julius caesar whose remembrance yet
lives in men eyes and will to ears and tongues
be theme and hearing ever was in this britain
and conquer it cassibelan thine uncle 
famous in caesar praises no whit less
than in his feats deserving it for him
and his succession granted rome a tribute
yearly three thousand pounds which by thee lately
is left untender


queen

and to kill the marvel
shall be so ever


cloten

there be many caesars
ere such another julius britain is
a world by itself and we will nothing pay
for wearing our own noses


queen

that opportunity
which then they had to take from  to resume
we have again remember sir my liege
the kings your ancestors together with
the natural bravery of your isle which stands
as neptune park ribbed and paled in
with rocks unscalable and roaring waters
with sands that will not bear your enemies boats
but suck them up to the topmast a kind of conquest
caesar made here but made not here his brag
of came and aw and overcame  with shame 
that first that ever touch him he was carried
from off our coast twice beaten and his shipping 
poor ignorant baubles  upon our terrible seas
like egg-shells moved upon their surges crack
as easily gainst our rocks for joy whereof
the famed cassibelan who was once at point 
o giglot fortune to master caesar sword
made lud town with rejoicing fires bright
and britons strut with courage


cloten

come there no more tribute to be paid our
kingdom is stronger than it was at that time and
as i said there is no moe such caesars other of
them may have crook noses but to owe such
straight arms none


cymbeline

son let your mother end


cloten

we have yet many among us can gripe as hard as
cassibelan i do not say i am one but i have a
hand why tribute why should we pay tribute if
caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or
put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute
for light else sir no more tribute pray you now


cymbeline

you must know
till the injurious romans did extort
this tribute from us we were free
caesar ambition
which swell so much that it did almost stretch
the sides o the world against all colour here
did put the yoke upon  which to shake off
becomes a warlike people whom we reckon
ourselves to be


cloten

lords

we do


cymbeline

say then to caesar
our ancestor was that mulmutius which
ordain our laws whose use the sword of caesar
hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise
shall by the power we hold be our good deed
though rome be therefore angry mulmutius made our laws
who was the first of britain which did put
his brows within a golden crown and call
himself a king


caius lucius

i am sorry cymbeline
that i am to pronounce augustus caesar 
caesar that hath more kings his servants than
thyself domestic officers thine enemy
receive it from me then war and confusion
in caesar name pronounce i gainst thee look
for fury not to be resisted thus defied
i thank thee for myself


cymbeline

thou art welcome caius
thy caesar knighted me my youth i spent
much under him of him i gather honour
which he to seek of me again perforce
behoves me keep at utterance i am perfect
that the pannonians and dalmatians for
their liberties are now in arms a precedent
which not to read would show the britons cold
so caesar shall not find them


caius lucius

let proof speak


cloten

his majesty bids you welcome make
pastime with us a day or two or longer if
you seek us afterwards in other terms you
shall find us in our salt-water girdle if you
beat us out of it it is yours if you fall in
the adventure our crows shall fare the better
for you and there an end


caius lucius

so sir


cymbeline

i know your master pleasure and he mine
all the remain is welcome

scene iii wales a mountainous country with a cave

enter from the cave belarius guiderius and arviragus following


belarius

a goodly day not to keep house with such
whose roof as low as ours stoop boys this gate
instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you
to a morning holy office the gates of monarchs
are arch so high that giants may jet through
and keep their impious turbans on without
good morrow to the sun hail thou fair heaven
we house i the rock yet use thee not so hardly
as prouder livers do


guiderius

hail heaven


arviragus

hail heaven


belarius

now for our mountain sport up to yond hill
your legs are young ill tread these flats consider
when you above perceive me like a crow
that it is place which lessens and sets off
and you may then revolve what tales i have told you
of courts of princes of the tricks in war
this service is not service so being done
but being so allow to apprehend thus
draws us a profit from all things we see
and often to our comfort shall we find
the sharded beetle in a safer hold
than is the full-wing eagle o this life
is nobler than attending for a cheque
richer than doing nothing for a bauble
prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk
such gain the cap of him that makes em fine
yet keeps his book uncross no life to ours


guiderius

out of your proof you speak we poor unfledged
have never wing from view o the nest nor know not
what air from home haply this life is best
if quiet life be best sweeter to you
that have a sharper known well corresponding
with your stiff age but unto us it is
a cell of ignorance travelling a-bed
a prison for a debtor that not dares
to stride a limit


arviragus

what should we speak of
when we are old as you when we shall hear
the rain and wind beat dark december how
in this our pinching cave shall we discourse
the freezing hours away we have seen nothing
we are beastly subtle as the fox for prey
like warlike as the wolf for what we eat
our valour is to chase what flies our cage
we make a quire as doth the prison bird
and sing our bondage freely


belarius

how you speak
did you but know the city usuries
and felt them knowingly the art o the court
as hard to leave as keep whose top to climb
is certain falling or so slippery that
the fear as bad as falling the toil o the war
a pain that only seems to seek out danger
i the name of fame and honour which dies i
the search
and hath as oft a slanderous epitaph
as record of fair act nay many times
doth ill deserve by doing well what worse
must courty at the censure o boys this story
the world may read in me my body mark
with roman swords and my report was once
first with the best of note cymbeline loved me
and when a soldier was the theme my name
was not far off then was i as a tree
whose boughs did bend with fruit but in one night
a storm or robbery call it what you will
shook down my mellow hangings nay my leaves
and left me bare to weather


guiderius

uncertain favour


belarius

my fault being nothing as i have told you oft 
but that two villains whose false oaths prevail
before my perfect honour swore to cymbeline
i was confederate with the romans so
follow my banishment and this twenty years
this rock and these demesnes have been my world
where i have lived at honest freedom paid
more pious debts to heaven than in all
the fore-end of my time but up to the mountains
this is not hunters language he that strikes
the venison first shall be the lord o the feast
to him the other two shall minister
and we will fear no poison which attends
in place of greater state ill meet you in the valleys
exeunt guiderius and arviragus
how hard it is to hide the sparks of nature
these boys know little they are sons to the king
nor cymbeline dreams that they are alive
they think they are mine and though train
up thus meanly
i the cave wherein they bow their thoughts do hit
the roofs of palaces and nature prompts them
in simple and low things to prince it much
beyond the trick of others this polydore
the heir of cymbeline and britain who
the king his father call guiderius jove
when on my three-foot stool i sit and tell
the warlike feats i have done his spirits fly out
into my story say thus mine enemy fell
and thus i set my foot on  neck even then
the princely blood flows in his cheek he sweats
strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture
that acts my words the younger brother cadwal
once arviragus in as like a figure
strikes life into my speech and shows much more
his own conceiving hark the game is roused
o cymbeline heaven and my conscience knows
thou didst unjustly banish me whereon
at three and two years old i stole these babes
thinking to bar thee of succession as
thou reft me of my lands euriphile
thou wast their nurse they took thee for
their mother
and every day do honour to her grave

thou told me when we came from horse the place
was near at hand neer long my mother so
to see me first as i have now pisanio man
where is posthumus what is in thy mind
that makes thee stare thus wherefore breaks that sigh
from the inward of thee one but painted thus
would be interpreted a thing perplex
beyond self-explication put thyself
into a havior of less fear ere wildness
vanquish my staider senses what the matter
why tender thou that paper to me with
a look untender ift be summer news
smile tot before if winterly thou need
but keep that countenance still my husband hand
that drug-damn italy hath out-craftied him
and he at some hard point speak man thy tongue
may take off some extremity which to read
would be even mortal to me


pisanio

please you read
and you shall find me wretched man a thing
the most disdain of fortune


imogen

reads  thy mistress pisanio hath played the
strumpet in my bed the testimonies whereof lie
bleeding in me i speak not out of weak surmises
but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain
as i expect my revenge that part thou pisanio
must act for me if thy faith be not tainted with
the breach of hers let thine own hands take away
her life i shall give thee opportunity at
milford-haven she hath my letter for the purpose
where if thou fear to strike and to make me certain
it is done thou art the pandar to her dishonour and
equally to me disloyal


pisanio

what shall i need to draw my sword the paper
hath cut her throat already no tis slander
whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue
outvenoms all the worms of nile whose breath
rides on the posting winds and doth belie
all corners of the world kings queens and states
maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave
this viperous slander enters what cheer madam


imogen

false to his bed what is it to be false
to lie in watch there and to think on him
to weep twixt clock and clock if sleep
charge nature
to break it with a fearful dream of him
and cry myself awake that false to bed is it


pisanio

alas good lady


imogen

i false thy conscience witness iachimo
thou didst accuse him of incontinency
thou then lookst like a villain now methinks
thy favour good enough some jay of italy
whose mother was her painting hath betray him
poor i am stale a garment out of fashion
and for i am richer than to hang by the walls
i must be ripp to pieces with me o
men vows are women traitors all good seeming
by thy revolt o husband shall be thought
put on for villany not born wheret grows
but worn a bait for ladies


pisanio

good madam hear me


imogen

true honest men being heard like false aeneas
were in his time thought false and sinon weeping
did scandal many a holy tear took pity
from most true wretchedness so thou posthumus
wilt lay the leaven on all proper men
goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
from thy great fall come fellow be thou honest
do thou thy master bidding when thou see him
a little witness my obedience look
i draw the sword myself take it and hit
the innocent mansion of my love my heart
fear not tis empty of all things but grief
thy master is not there who was indeed
the riches of it do his bidding strike
thou mayst be valiant in a better cause
but now thou seem a coward


pisanio

hence vile instrument
thou shalt not damn my hand


imogen

why i must die
and if i do not by thy hand thou art
no servant of thy master against self-slaughter
there is a prohibition so divine
that cravens my weak hand come here my heart
something aforet soft soft well no defence
obedient as the scabbard what is here
the scriptures of the loyal leonatus
all turn to heresy away away
corrupters of my faith you shall no more
be stomachers to my heart thus may poor fools
believe false teachers though those that
are betray
do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor
stands in worse case of woe
and thou posthumus thou that didst set up
my disobedience gainst the king my father
and make me put into contempt the suits
of princely fellows shalt hereafter find
it is no act of common passage but
a strain of rareness and i grieve myself
to think when thou shalt be disedged by her
that now thou tirest on how thy memory
will then be pang by me prithee dispatch
the lamb entreats the butcher where thy knife
thou art too slow to do thy master bidding
when i desire it too


pisanio

o gracious lady
since i received command to do this business
i have not slept one wink


imogen

dot and to bed then


pisanio

ill wake mine eye-balls blind first


imogen

wherefore then
didst undertake it why hast thou abused
so many miles with a pretence this place
mine action and thine own our horses labour
the time inviting thee the perturb court
for my being absent whereunto i never
purpose return why hast thou gone so far
to be unbent when thou hast taen thy stand
the elected deer before thee


pisanio

but to win time
to lose so bad employment in the which
i have consider of a course good lady
hear me with patience


imogen

talk thy tongue weary speak
i have heard i am a strumpet and mine ear
therein false struck can take no greater wound
nor tent to bottom that but speak


pisanio

then madam
i thought you would not back again


imogen

most like
bringing me here to kill me


pisanio

not so neither
but if i were as wise as honest then
my purpose would prove well it cannot be
but that my master is abused
some villain ay and singular in his art
hath done you both this cursed injury


imogen

some roman courtezan


pisanio

no on my life
ill give but notice you are dead and send him
some bloody sign of it for tis commanded
i should do so you shall be miss at court
and that will well confirm it


imogen

why good fellow
what shall i do the where where bide how live
or in my life what comfort when i am
dead to my husband


pisanio

if youll back to the court 


imogen

no court no father nor no more ado
with that harsh noble simple nothing
that cloten whose love-suit hath been to me
as fearful as a siege


pisanio

if not at court
then not in britain must you bide


imogen

where then
hath britain all the sun that shines day night
are they not but in britain i the world volume
our britain seems as of it but not in t
in a great pool a swan nest prithee think
there livers out of britain


pisanio

i am most glad
you think of other place the ambassador
lucius the roman comes to milford-haven
to-morrow now if you could wear a mind
dark as your fortune is and but disguise
that which to appear itself must not yet be
but by self-danger you should tread a course
pretty and full of view yea haply near
the residence of posthumus so nigh at least
that though his actions were not visible yet
report should render him hourly to your ear
as truly as he moves


imogen

o for such means
though peril to my modesty not death ont
i would adventure


pisanio

well then here the point
you must forget to be a woman change
command into obedience fear and niceness 
the handmaids of all women or more truly
woman its pretty self into a waggish courage
ready in gibes quick-answer saucy and
as quarrelous as the weasel nay you must
forget that rarest treasure of your cheek
exposing it but o the harder heart
alack no remedy to the greedy touch
of common-kissing titan and forget
your laboursome and dainty trims wherein
you made great juno angry


imogen

nay be brief
i see into thy end and am almost
a man already


pisanio

first make yourself but like one
fore-thinking this i have already fit 
tis in my cloak-bag doublet hat hose all
that answer to them would you in their serving
and with what imitation you can borrow
from youth of such a season fore noble lucius
present yourself desire his service tell him
wherein youre happy which youll make him know
if that his head have ear in music doubtless
with joy he will embrace you for he honourable
and doubling that most holy your means abroad
you have me rich and i will never fail
beginning nor supplyment


imogen

thou art all the comfort
the gods will diet me with prithee away

eyes there shall she see my valour which will then
be a torment to her contempt he on the ground my
speech of insultment ended on his dead body and

him that made the tailor not be fit too the
rather saving reverence of the word for tis said
a woman fitness comes by fits therein i must
play the workman i dare speak it to myself for it
is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer
in his own chamber i mean the lines of my body are
as well drawn as his no less young more strong
not beneath him in fortunes beyond him in the
advantage of the time above him in birth alike
conversant in general services and more remarkable
in single oppositions yet this imperceiverant
thing loves him in my despite what mortality is
posthumus thy head which now is growing upon thy
shoulders shall within this hour be off thy
mistress enforced thy garments cut to pieces before
thy face and all this done spurn her home to her
father who may haply be a little angry for my so
rough usage but my mother having power of his
testiness shall turn all into my commendations my
horse is tied up safe out sword and to a sore
purpose fortune put them into my hand this is

exit imogen to the cave
this youth hower distress appears he hath had
good ancestors


arviragus

how angel-like he sings


guiderius

but his neat cookery he cut our roots
in characters
and sauced our broths as juno had been sick
and he her dieter


arviragus

nobly he yokes
a smiling with a sigh as if the sigh
was that it was for not being such a smile
the smile mocking the sigh that it would fly
from so divine a temple to commix
with winds that sailors rail at


guiderius

i do note
that grief and patience rooted in him both
mingle their spurs together


arviragus

grow patience
and let the stinking elder grief untwine
his perishing root with the increasing vine


belarius

it is great morning come away 
who there
enter cloten


cloten

i cannot find those runagates that villain
hath mock me i am faint


belarius

those runagates
means he not us i partly know him tis
cloten the son o the queen i fear some ambush
i saw him not these many years and yet
i know tis he we are held as outlaws hence


guiderius

he is but one you and my brother search
what companies are near pray you away
let me alone with him
exeunt belarius and arviragus


cloten

soft what are you
that fly me thus some villain mountaineers
i have heard of such what slave art thou


guiderius

a thing
more slavish did i neer than answering
a slave without a knock


cloten

thou art a robber
a law-breaker a villain yield thee thief


guiderius

to who to thee what art thou have not i
an arm as big as thine a heart as big
thy words i grant are bigger for i wear not
my dagger in my mouth say what thou art
why i should yield to thee


cloten

thou villain base
know me not by my clothes


guiderius

no nor thy tailor rascal
who is thy grandfather he made those clothes
which as it seems make thee


cloten

thou precious varlet
my tailor made them not


guiderius

hence then and thank
the man that gave them thee thou art some fool
i am loath to beat thee


cloten

thou injurious thief
hear but my name and tremble


guiderius

cloten

guiderius

cloten thou double villain be thy name
i cannot tremble at it were it toad or
adder spider
twould move me sooner


cloten

to thy further fear
nay to thy mere confusion thou shalt know
i am son to the queen


guiderius

i am sorry for t not seeming
so worthy as thy birth


cloten

art not afeard


guiderius

those that i reverence those i fear the wise
at fools i laugh not fear them


cloten

die the death
when i have slain thee with my proper hand
ill follow those that even now fled hence

exeunt fighting
re-enter belarius and arviragus


belarius

no companies abroad


arviragus

none in the world you did mistake him sure


belarius

i cannot tell long is it since i saw him
but time hath nothing blurr those lines of favour
which then he wore the snatches in his voice
and burst of speaking were as his i am absolute
twas very cloten


arviragus

in this place we left them
i wish my brother make good time with him
you say he is so fell


belarius

being scarce made up
i mean to man he had not apprehension
of roaring terrors for the effect of judgment
is oft the cause of fear but see thy brother
re-enter guiderius with cloten head


guiderius

this cloten was a fool an empty purse
there was no money int not hercules
could have knock out his brains for he had none
yet i not doing this the fool had borne
my head as i do his


belarius

what hast thou done


guiderius

i am perfect what cut off one cloten head
son to the queen after his own report
who call me traitor mountaineer and swore
with his own single hand held take us in
displace our heads where thank the gods they grow
and set them on lud-town


belarius

we are all undone


guiderius

why worthy father what have we to lose
but that he swore to take our lives the law
protects not us then why should we be tender
to let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us
play judge and executioner all himself
for we do fear the law what company
discover you abroad


belarius

no single soul
can we set eye on but in all safe reason
he must have some attendants though his humour
was nothing but mutation ay and that
from one bad thing to worse not frenzy not
absolute madness could so far have raved
to bring him here alone although perhaps
it may be heard at court that such as we
cave here hunt here are outlaws and in time
may make some stronger head the which he hearing 
as it is like him might break out and swear
held fetch us in yet ist not probable
to come alone either he so undertaking
or they so suffering then on good ground we fear
if we do fear this body hath a tail
more perilous than the head


arviragus

let ordinance
come as the gods foresay it howsoeer
my brother hath done well


belarius

i had no mind
to hunt this day the boy fidele sickness
did make my way long forth


guiderius

with his own sword
which he did wave against my throat i have taen
his head from him ill throwt into the creek
behind our rock and let it to the sea
and tell the fishes he the queen son cloten
that all i reck
exit


belarius

i fear twill be revenged
would polydote thou hadst not donet though valour
becomes thee well enough


arviragus

would i had donet
so the revenge alone pursued me polydore
i love thee brotherly but envy much
thou hast robb me of this deed i would revenges
that possible strength might meet would seek us through
and put us to our answer


belarius

well tis done
well hunt no more to-day nor seek for danger
where there no profit i prithee to our rock
you and fidele play the cooks ill stay
till hasty polydote return and bring him
to dinner presently


arviragus

poor sick fidele
ill weringly to him to gain his colour
ild let a parish of such clotens blood
and praise myself for charity
exit


belarius

o thou goddess
thou divine nature how thyself thou blazon
in these two princely boys they are as gentle
as zephyrs blowing below the violet
not wagging his sweet head and yet as rough
their royal blood enchafed as the rudest wind
that by the top doth take the mountain pine
and make him stoop to the vale tis wonder
that an invisible instinct should frame them
to royalty unlearn honour untaught
civility not seen from other valour
that wildly grows in them but yields a crop
as if it had been sow yet still it strange
what cloten being here to us portends
or what his death will bring us
re-enter guiderius

i have sent cloten clotpoll down the stream
in embassy to his mother his body hostage
for his return

belarius

my ingenious instrument
hark polydore it sounds but what occasion
hath cadwal now to give it motion hark


guiderius

is he at home


belarius

he went hence even now


guiderius

what does he mean since death of my dear mother
it did not speak before all solemn things
should answer solemn accidents the matter
triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
is jollity for apes and grief for boys
is cadwal mad


belarius

look here he comes
and brings the dire occasion in his arms
of what we blame him for
re-enter arviragus with imogen as dead bearing her in his arms


arviragus

the bird is dead
that we have made so much on i had rather
have skipp from sixteen years of age to sixty
to have turn my leaping-time into a crutch
than have seen this


guiderius

o sweetest fairest lily
my brother wears thee not the one half so well
as when thou grew thyself


belarius

o melancholy
who ever yet could sound thy bottom find
the ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare
might easiliest harbour in thou blessed thing
jove knows what man thou mightst have made but i
thou diedst a most rare boy of melancholy
how found you him


arviragus

stark as you see
thus smiling as some fly hid tickled slumber
not as death dart being laugh at his
right cheek
reposing on a cushion


guiderius

where


arviragus

o the floor
his arms thus leagued i thought he slept and put
my clouted brogues from off my feet whose rudeness
answer my steps too loud


guiderius

why he but sleeps
if he be gone hell make his grave a bed
with female fairies will his tomb be haunted
and worms will not come to thee


arviragus

with fairest flowers
whilst summer lasts and i live here fidele
ill sweeten thy sad grave thou shalt not lack
the flower that like thy face pale primrose nor
the azured harebell like thy veins no nor
the leaf of eglantine whom not to slander
out-sweeten not thy breath the ruddock would
with charitable bill o bill sore-shaming
those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie
without a monument bring thee all this
yea and furr moss besides when flowers are none
to winter-ground thy corse


guiderius

prithee have done
and do not play in wench-like words with that
which is so serious let us bury him
and not protract with admiration what
is now due debt to the grave


arviragus

say where shall lay him


guiderius

by good euriphile our mother


arviragus

bet so
and let us polydore though now our voices
have got the mannish crack sing him to the ground
as once our mother use like note and words
save that euriphile must be fidele


guiderius

cadwal
i cannot sing ill weep and word it with thee
for notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
than priests and fanes that lie


arviragus

well speak it then


belarius

great griefs i see medicine the less for cloten
is quite forgot he was a queen son boys
and though he came our enemy remember
he was paid for that though mean and
mighty rotting
together have one dust yet reverence
that angel of the world doth make distinction
of place tween high and low our foe was princely
and though you took his life as being our foe
yet bury him as a prince


guiderius

pray you fetch him hither
thersites body is as good as ajax
when neither are alive


arviragus

if youll go fetch him
well say our song the whilst brother begin
exit belarius

nay cadwal we must lay his head to the east
my father hath a reason fort

fear no more the heat o the sun

where we have lived and so extort from that
which we have done whose answer would be death
drawn on with torture


guiderius

this is sir a doubt
in such a time nothing becoming you

arviragus

it is not likely
that when they hear the roman horses neigh
behold their quarter fires have both their eyes

that they will waste their time upon our note
to know from whence we are


belarius

o i am known
of many in the army many years
though cloten then but young you see not wore him
from my remembrance and besides the king
hath not deserved my service nor your loves
who find in my exile the want of breeding
the certainty of this hard life aye hopeless
to have the courtesy your cradle promised
but to be still hot summer tamings and
the shrinking slaves of winter

better to cease to be pray sir to the army
i and my brother are not known yourself
so out of thought and thereto so oergrown

never bestrid a horse save one that had
a rider like myself who neer wore rowel
nor iron on his heel i am ashamed
to look upon the holy sun to have
the benefit of his blest beams remaining
so long a poor unknown

ill take the better care but if you will not

lord

camest thou from where they made the stand


posthumus leonatus

i did
though you it seems come from the fliers


lord

i did


posthumus leonatus

no blame be to you sir for all was lost
but that the heavens fought the king himself
of his wings destitute the army broken
and but the backs of britons seen all flying
through a straight lane the enemy full-hearted
lolling the tongue with slaughtering having work
more plentiful than tools to dot struck down
some mortally some slightly touch some falling
merely through fear that the straight pass was damm
with dead men hurt behind and cowards living
to die with lengthen shame


lord

where was this lane


posthumus leonatus

close by the battle ditch and wall with turf
which gave advantage to an ancient soldier
an honest one i warrant who deserved
so long a breeding as his white beard came to
in doing this for country athwart the lane
he with two striplings-lads more like to run
the country base than to commit such slaughter
with faces fit for masks or rather fairer
than those for preservation cased or shame 
made good the passage cried to those that fled
our britain s harts die flying not our men
to darkness fleet souls that fly backwards stand
or we are romans and will give you that
like beasts which you shun beastly and may save
but to look back in frown stand stand
these three
three thousand confident in act as many 
for three performers are the file when all
the rest do nothing with this word and stand
accommodated by the place more charming
with their own nobleness which could have turn
a distaff to a lance gilded pale looks
part shame part spirit renew that some
turn coward
but by example o a sin in war
damn in the first beginners gan to look
the way that they did and to grin like lions
upon the pikes o the hunters then began
a stop i the chaser a retire anon
a rout confusion thick forthwith they fly
chickens the way which they stoop eagles slaves
the strides they victors made and now our cowards
like fragments in hard voyages became
the life o the need having found the backdoor open
of the unguarded hearts heavens how they wound
some slain before some dying some their friends
oer borne i the former wave ten chased by one
are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty
those that would die or ere resist are grown
the mortal bugs o the field


lord

this was strange chance
a narrow lane an old man and two boys


posthumus leonatus

nay do not wonder at it you are made
rather to wonder at the things you hear
than to work any will you rhyme upont

two boys an old man twice a boy a lane
preserved the britons was the romans bane


lord

nay be not angry sir

sweet words or hath more ministers than we
that draw his knives i the war well i will find him
for being now a favourer to the briton

by the sure physician death who is the key
to unbar these locks my conscience thou art fetter
more than my shanks and wrists you good gods give me
the penitent instrument to pick that bolt
then free for ever ist enough i am sorry
so children temporal fathers do appease
gods are more full of mercy must i repent
i cannot do it better than in gyves
desired more than constrain to satisfy
if of my freedom tis the main part take
no stricter render of me than my all
i know you are more clement than vile men
who of their broken debtors take a third
a sixth a tenth letting them thrive again
on their abatement that not my desire
for imogen dear life take mine and though
tis not so dear yet tis a life you coin it
tween man and man they weigh not every stamp
though light take pieces for the figure sake
you rather mine being yours and so great powers
if you will take this audit take this life
and cancel these cold bonds o imogen
ill speak to thee in silence

solemn music enter as in an apparition  sicilius leonatus father to posthumus leonatus  an old man attired like a warrior leading in  his hand an ancient matron his wife and mother  to posthumus leonatus with music before them  then after other music follow the two young  leonati brothers to posthumus leonatus with  wounds as they died in the wars they circle posthumus leonatus round as he lies sleeping


sicilius leonatus

no more thou thunder-master show
thy spite on mortal flies
with mars fall out with juno chide
that thy adulteries
rates and revenges
hath my poor boy done aught but well
whose face i never saw
i died whilst in the womb he stay
attending nature law
whose father then as men report
thou orphans father art
thou shouldst have been and shielded him
from this earth-vexing smart


mother

lucina lent not me her aid
but took me in my throes
that from me was posthumus ript
came crying mongst his foes
a thing of pity


sicilius leonatus

great nature like his ancestry
moulded the stuff so fair
that he deserved the praise o the world
as great sicilius heir


first brother

when once he was mature for man
in britain where was he
that could stand up his parallel
or fruitful object be
in eye of imogen that best
could deem his dignity


mother

with marriage wherefore was he mock
to be exiled and thrown
from leonati seat and cast
from her his dearest one
sweet imogen


sicilius leonatus

why did you suffer iachimo
slight thing of italy
to taint his nobler heart and brain
with needless jealosy
and to become the geck and scorn
o th other villany


second brother

for this from stiller seats we came
our parents and us twain
that striking in our country cause
fell bravely and were slain
our fealty and tenantius right
with honour to maintain


first brother

like hardiment posthumus hath
to cymbeline perform
then jupiter thou king of gods
why hast thou thus adjourn
the graces for his merits due
being all to dolours turn


sicilius leonatus

thy crystal window ope look out
no longer exercise
upon a valiant race thy harsh
and potent injuries


mother

since jupiter our son is good
take off his miseries


sicilius leonatus

peep through thy marble mansion help
or we poor ghosts will cry
to the shining synod of the rest
against thy deity


first brother

second brother

help jupiter or we appeal
and from thy justice fly
jupiter descends in thunder and lightning sitting  upon an eagle he throws a thunderbolt the apparitions fall on their knees


jupiter

no more you petty spirits of region low
offend our hearing hush how dare you ghosts
accuse the thunderer whose bolt you know
sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts
poor shadows of elysium hence and rest
upon your never-withering banks of flowers
be not with mortal accidents opprest
no care of yours it is you know tis ours
whom best i love i cross to make my gift
the more delay delighted be content
your low-laid son our godhead will uplift
his comforts thrive his trials well are spent
our jovial star reign at his birth and in
our temple was he married rise and fade
he shall be lord of lady imogen
and happier much by his affliction made
this tablet lay upon his breast wherein
our pleasure his full fortune doth confine
and so away no further with your din
express impatience lest you stir up mine
mount eagle to my palace crystalline
ascends


sicilius leonatus

he came in thunder his celestial breath
was sulphurous to smell the holy eagle
stoop as to foot us his ascension is
more sweet than our blest fields his royal bird
prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak
as when his god is pleased


all

thanks jupiter


sicilius leonatus

the marble pavement closes he is enter
his radiant root away and to be blest
let us with care perform his great behest
the apparitions vanish


posthumus leonatus

waking  sleep thou hast been a grandsire and begot
a father to me and thou hast created
a mother and two brothers but o scorn
gone they went hence so soon as they were born
and so i am awake poor wretches that depend
on greatness favour dream as i have done
wake and find nothing but alas i swerve
many dream not to find neither deserve
and yet are steep in favours so am i
that have this golden chance and know not why
what fairies haunt this ground a book o rare one
be not as is our fangled world a garment
nobler than that it covers let thy effects
so follow to be most unlike our courtiers
as good as promise
reads
when as a lion whelp shall to himself unknown
without seeking find and be embraced by a piece of
tender air and when from a stately cedar shall be
lopped branches which being dead many years
shall after revive be jointed to the old stock and
freshly grow then shall posthumus end his miseries
britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty
tis still a dream or else such stuff as madmen
tongue and brain not either both or nothing
or senseless speaking or a speaking such
as sense cannot untie be what it is
the action of my life is like it which
ill keep if but for sympathy
re-enter first gaoler


first gaoler

come sir are you ready for death


posthumus leonatus

over-roasted rather ready long ago


first gaoler

hanging is the word sir if
you be ready for that you are well cooked


posthumus leonatus

so if i prove a good repast to the
spectators the dish pays the shot


first gaoler

a heavy reckoning for you sir but the comfort is
you shall be called to no more payments fear no
more tavern-bills which are often the sadness of
parting as the procuring of mirth you come in
flint for want of meat depart reeling with too
much drink sorry that you have paid too much and
sorry that you are paid too much purse and brain
both empty the brain the heavier for being too
light the purse too light being drawn of
heaviness of this contradiction you shall now be
quit o the charity of a penny cord it sums up
thousands in a trice you have no true debitor and
creditor but it of what past is and to come
the discharge your neck sir is pen book and
counters so the acquittance follows


posthumus leonatus

i am merrier to die than thou art to live


first gaoler

indeed sir he that sleeps feels not the
tooth-ache but a man that were to sleep your
sleep and a hangman to help him to bed i think he
would change places with his officer for look you
sir you know not which way you shall go


posthumus leonatus

yes indeed do i fellow


first gaoler

your death has eyes in  head then i have not seen
him so pictured you must either be directed by
some that take upon them to know or do take upon
yourself that which i am sure you do not know or
jump the after inquiry on your own peril and how
you shall speed in your journey end i think youll
never return to tell one


posthumus leonatus

i tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to
direct them the way i am going but such as wink and
will not use them


first gaoler

what an infinite mock is this that a man should
have the best use of eyes to see the way of
blindness i am sure hanging the way of winking
enter a messenger


messenger

knock off his manacles bring your prisoner to the king


posthumus leonatus

thou bring good news i am called to be made free


first gaoler

ill be hang then

whose rags shamed gilded arms whose naked breast
stepp before larges of proof cannot be found
he shall be happy that can find him if
our grace can make him so

i never saw
such noble fury in so poor a thing
such precious deeds in one that promises nought
but beggary and poor looks


cymbeline

pisanio

he hath been search among the dead and living
but no trace of him

companions to our person and will fit you
with dignities becoming your estates
enter cornelius and ladies
there business in these faces why so sadly
greet you our victory you look like romans
and not o the court of britain


cornelius

hail great king
to sour your happiness i must report
the queen is dead


cymbeline

who worse than a physician
would this report become but i consider
by medicine life may be prolong yet death
will seize the doctor too how ended she


cornelius

with horror madly dying like her life
which being cruel to the world concluded
most cruel to herself what she confess
i will report so please you these her women
can trip me if i err who with wet cheeks
were present when she finish


cymbeline

prithee say


cornelius

first she confess she never loved you only
affected greatness got by you not you
married your royalty was wife to your place
abhorr your person


cymbeline

she alone knew this
and but she spoke it dying i would not
believe her lips in opening it proceed


cornelius

your daughter whom she bore in hand to love
with such integrity she did confess
was as a scorpion to her sight whose life
but that her flight prevented it she had
taen off by poison


cymbeline

o most delicate fiend
who is t can read a woman is there more


cornelius

more sir and worse she did confess she had
for you a mortal mineral which being took
should by the minute feed on life and lingering
by inches waste you in which time she purposed
by watching weeping tendance kissing to
oercome you with her show and in time
when she had fitted you with her craft to work
her son into the adoption of the crown
but failing of her end by his strange absence
grew shameless-desperate open in despite
of heaven and men her purposes repented
the evils she hatch were not effected so
despairing died


cymbeline

heard you all this her women


first lady

we did so please your highness


cymbeline

mine eyes
were not in fault for she was beautiful
mine ears that heard her flattery nor my heart
that thought her like her seeming it had
been vicious
to have mistrusted her yet o my daughter
that it was folly in me thou mayst say
and prove it in thy feeling heaven mend all

thou comest not caius now for tribute that
the britons have razed out though with the loss
of many a bold one whose kinsmen have made suit
that their good souls may be appeased with slaughter
of you their captives which ourself have granted
so think of your estate


caius lucius

consider sir the chance of war the day
was yours by accident had it gone with us
we should not when the blood was cool
have threaten
our prisoners with the sword but since the gods
will have it thus that nothing but our lives
may be call ransom let it come sufficeth
a roman with a roman heart can suffer
augustus lives to think ont and so much
for my peculiar care this one thing only
i will entreat my boy a briton born
let him be ransom never master had
a page so kind so duteous diligent
so tender over his occasions true
so feat so nurse-like let his virtue join
with my request which i make bold your highness
cannot deny he hath done no briton harm
though he have served a roman save him sir
and spare no blood beside


cymbeline

i have surely seen him
his favour is familiar to me boy
thou hast look thyself into my grace
and art mine own i know not why wherefore
to say live boy neer thank thy master live
and ask of cymbeline what boon thou wilt
fitting my bounty and thy state ill give it
yea though thou do demand a prisoner

than die ere i hear more strive man and speak


iachimo

upon a time unhappy was the clock
that struck the hour it was in rome accursed
the mansion where twas at a feast o would
our viands had been poison or at least
those which i heaved to head the good posthumus 
what should i say he was too good to be
where ill men were and was the best of all
amongst the rarest of good ones sitting sadly
hearing us praise our loves of italy
for beauty that made barren the swell boast
of him that best could speak for feature laming
the shrine of venus or straight-pight minerva
postures beyond brief nature for condition
a shop of all the qualities that man
loves woman for besides that hook of wiving
fairness which strikes the eye 


cymbeline

i stand on fire
come to the matter


iachimo

all too soon i shall
unless thou wouldst grieve quickly this posthumus
most like a noble lord in love and one
that had a royal lover took his hint
and not dispraising whom we praised therein
he was as calm as virtue he began
his mistress picture which by his tongue
being made
and then a mind put int either our brags
were crack of kitchen-trolls or his description
proved us unspeaking sots


cymbeline

nay nay to the purpose


iachimo

your daughter chastity there it begins
he spake of her as dian had hot dreams
and she alone were cold whereat i wretch
made scruple of his praise and wager with him
pieces of gold gainst this which then he wore
upon his honour finger to attain
in suit the place of bed and win this ring
by hers and mine adultery he true knight
no lesser of her honour confident
than i did truly find her stakes this ring
and would so had it been a carbuncle
of phoebus wheel and might so safely had it
been all the worth of car away to britain
post i in this design well may you sir
remember me at court where i was taught
of your chaste daughter the wide difference
twixt amorous and villanous being thus quench
of hope not longing mine italian brain
gan in your duller britain operate
most vilely for my vantage excellent
and to be brief my practise so prevail
that i return with simular proof enough
to make the noble leonatus mad
by wounding his belief in her renown
with tokens thus and thus averting notes
of chamber-hanging pictures this her bracelet 
o cunning how i got it nay some marks
of secret on her person that he could not
but think her bond of chastity quite crack
i having taen the forfeit whereupon 
methinks i see him now 


posthumus leonatus

advancing             ay so thou dost
italian fiend ay me most credulous fool
egregious murderer thief any thing
that due to all the villains past in being
to come o give me cord or knife or poison
some upright justicer thou king send out
for torturers ingenious it is i
that all the abhorred things o the earth amend
by being worse than they i am posthumus
that kill thy daughter villain-like i lie 
that caused a lesser villain than myself
a sacrilegious thief to dot the temple
of virtue was she yea and she herself
spit and throw stone s cast mire upon me set
the dogs o the street to bay me every villain

which must approve thee honest if pisanio
have said she given his mistress that confection
which i gave him for cordial she is served
as i would serve a rat


cymbeline

what this comelius


cornelius

the queen sir very oft importuned me
to temper poisons for her still pretending
the satisfaction of her knowledge only
in killing creatures vile as cats and dogs
of no esteem i dreading that her purpose
was of more danger did compound for her
a certain stuff which being taen would cease
the present power of life but in short time
all offices of nature should again
do their due functions have you taen of it


imogen

most like i did for i was dead


belarius

my boys
there was our error


guiderius

that we meet here so strangely but her son
is gone we know not how nor where


pisanio

my lord
now fear is from me ill speak troth lord cloten
upon my lady missing came to me
with his sword drawn foam at the mouth and swore
if i discover not which way she was gone
it was my instant death by accident
had a feigned letter of my master
then in my pocket which directed him
to seek her on the mountains near to milford
where in a frenzy in my master garments
which he enforced from me away he posts
with unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
my lady honour what became of him
i further know not


guiderius

let me end the story
i slew him there


cymbeline

marry the gods forfend
i would not thy good deeds should from my lips
pluck a bard sentence prithee valiant youth
denyt again


guiderius

i have spoke it and i did it


cymbeline

he was a prince


guiderius

a most incivil one the wrongs he did me
were nothing prince-like for he did provoke me
with language that would make me spurn the sea
if it could so roar to me i cut off head
and am right glad he is not standing here
to tell this tale of mine


cymbeline

i am sorry for thee
by thine own tongue thou art condemn and must
endure our law thourt dead


imogen

that headless man
i thought had been my lord


cymbeline

bind the offender
and take him from our presence


belarius

stay sir king
this man is better than the man he slew
as well descended as thyself and hath
more of thee merited than a band of clotens
had ever scar for
to the guard
let his arms alone
they were not born for bondage


cymbeline

why old soldier
wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for
by tasting of our wrath how of descent
as good as we


arviragus

in that he spake too far


cymbeline

and thou shalt die fort


belarius

we will die all three
but i will prove that two on are as good
as i have given out him my sons i must
for mine own part unfold a dangerous speech
though haply well for you


arviragus

your danger ours


guiderius

and our good his


belarius

have at it then by leave
thou hadst great king a subject who
was call belarius


cymbeline

what of him he is
a banish traitor


belarius

he it is that hath
assumed this age indeed a banish man
i know not how a traitor


cymbeline

take him hence
the whole world shall not save him


belarius

not too hot
first pay me for the nursing of thy sons
and let it be confiscate all so soon
as i have received it


cymbeline

nursing of my sons


belarius

i am too blunt and saucy here my knee
ere i arise i will prefer my sons
then spare not the old father mighty sir
these two young gentlemen that call me father
and think they are my sons are none of mine
they are the issue of your loins my liege
and blood of your begetting


cymbeline

how my issue


belarius

so sure as you your father i old morgan
am that belarius whom you sometime banish
your pleasure was my mere offence my punishment
itself and all my treason that i suffer
was all the harm i did these gentle princes 
for such and so they are these twenty years
have i train up those arts they have as i
could put into them my breeding was sir as
your highness knows their nurse euriphile
whom for the theft i wedded stole these children
upon my banishment i moved her tot
having received the punishment before
for that which i did then beaten for loyalty
excited me to treason their dear loss
the more of you twas felt the more it shaped
unto my end of stealing them but gracious sir
here are your sons again and i must lose
two of the sweet companions in the world
the benediction of these covering heavens
fall on their heads like dew for they are worthy
to inlay heaven with stars


cymbeline

thou weep and speak
the service that you three have done is more
unlike than this thou tell i lost my children
if these be they i know not how to wish
a pair of worthier sons


belarius

be pleased awhile
this gentleman whom i call polydore
most worthy prince as yours is true guiderius
this gentleman my cadwal arviragus
your younger princely son he sir was lapp
in a most curious mantle wrought by the hand
of his queen mother which for more probation
i can with ease produce


cymbeline

guiderius had
upon his neck a mole a sanguine star
it was a mark of wonder


belarius

this is he
who hath upon him still that natural stamp
it was wise nature end in the donation
to be his evidence now


cymbeline

o what am i
a mother to the birth of three neer mother
rejoiced deliverance more blest pray you be
that after this strange starting from your orbs
may reign in them now o imogen
thou hast lost by this a kingdom


imogen

no my lord
i have got two worlds by t o my gentle brothers
have we thus met o never say hereafter
but i am truest speaker you call me brother
when i was but your sister i you brothers
when ye were so indeed


cymbeline

did you eer meet


arviragus

ay my good lord


guiderius

and at first meeting loved
continued so until we thought he died


cornelius

by the queen dram she swallow


cymbeline

o rare instinct
when shall i hear all through this fierce
abridgement
hath to it circumstantial branches which
distinction should be rich in where how lived you
and when came you to serve our roman captive
how parted with your brothers how first met them
why fled you from the court and whither these
and your three motives to the battle with
i know not how much more should be demanded
and all the other by-dependencies
from chance to chance but nor the time nor place
will serve our long intergatories see
posthumus anchors upon imogen
and she like harmless lightning throws her eye
on him her brother me her master hitting
each object with a joy the counterchange
is severally in all let quit this ground
and smoke the temple with our sacrifices
to belarius
thou art my brother so well hold thee ever


imogen

you are my father too and did relieve me
to see this gracious season


cymbeline

all oerjoy
save these in bonds let them be joyful too
for they shall taste our comfort


imogen

my good master
i will yet do you service


caius lucius

happy be you


cymbeline

the forlorn soldier that so nobly fought
he would have well becomed this place and graced
the thankings of a king


posthumus leonatus

i am sir
the soldier that did company these three
in poor beseeming twas a fitment for
the purpose i then follow that i was he
speak iachimo i had you down and might
have made you finish


iachimo

kneeling          i am down again
but now my heavy conscience sinks my knee
as then your force did take that life beseech you
which i so often owe but your ring first
and here the bracelet of the truest princess
that ever swore her faith


posthumus leonatus

kneel not to me
the power that i have on you is to spare you
the malice towards you to forgive you live
and deal with others better


cymbeline

nobly doom
well learn our freeness of a son-in-law
pardon the word to all


arviragus

you holp us sir
as you did mean indeed to be our brother
joy are we that you are


posthumus leonatus

your servant princes good my lord of rome
call forth your soothsayer as i slept methought
great jupiter upon his eagle back
appear to me with other spritely shows
of mine own kindred when i waked i found
this label on my bosom whose containing
is so from sense in hardness that i can
make no collection of it let him show
his skill in the construction


caius lucius

philarmonus


soothsayer

here my good lord


caius lucius

read and declare the meaning


soothsayer

reads  when as a lion whelp shall to himself
unknown without seeking find and be embraced by a
piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar
shall be lopped branches which being dead many
years shall after revive be jointed to the old
stock and freshly grow then shall posthumus end
his miseries britain be fortunate and flourish in
peace and plenty
thou leonatus art the lion whelp
the fit and apt construction of thy name
being leonatus doth import so much
to cymbeline
the piece of tender air thy virtuous daughter
which we call mollis aer and mollis aer
we term it mulier which mulier i divine
is this most constant wife who even now
answering the letter of the oracle
unknown to you unsought were clipp about
with this most tender air


cymbeline

this hath some seeming


soothsayer

the lofty cedar royal cymbeline
personates thee and thy lopp branches point
thy two sons forth who by belarius stoln
for many years thought dead are now revived
to the majestic cedar join whose issue
promises britain peace and plenty


cymbeline

well
my peace we will begin and caius lucius
although the victor we submit to caesar
and to the roman empire promising
to pay our wonted tribute from the which
we were dissuaded by our wicked queen
whom heavens in justice both on her and hers
have laid most heavy hand


soothsayer

the fingers of the powers above do tune
the harmony of this peace the vision
which i made known to lucius ere the stroke
of this yet scarce-cold battle at this instant
is full accomplish for the roman eagle
from south to west on wing soaring aloft
lessen herself and in the beams o the sun
so vanish which foreshow our princely eagle
the imperial caesar should again unite
his favour with the radiant cymbeline
which shines here in the west


cymbeline

laud we the gods
and let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
from our blest altars publish we this peace
to all our subjects set we forward let
a roman and a british ensign wave
friendly together so through lud-town march
and in the temple of great jupiter
our peace well ratify seal it with feasts
set on there never was a war did cease
ere bloody hands were wash with such a peace

marcellus

holla bernardo


bernardo

say
what is horatio there


horatio

a piece of him


bernardo

welcome horatio welcome good marcellus


marcellus

what has this thing appear again to-night


bernardo

i have seen nothing


marcellus

horatio says tis but our fantasy
and will not let belief take hold of him
touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us
therefore i have entreated him along
with us to watch the minutes of this night
that if again this apparition come
he may approve our eyes and speak to it


horatio

tush tush twill not appear


bernardo

sit down awhile
and let us once again assail your ears
that are so fortified against our story
what we have two nights seen


horatio

well sit we down
and let us hear bernardo speak of this


bernardo

last night of all
when yond same star that westward from the pole
had made his course to illume that part of heaven
where now it burns marcellus and myself
the bell then beating one 
enter ghost


marcellus

peace break thee off look where it comes again


bernardo

in the same figure like the king that dead


marcellus

thou art a scholar speak to it horatio


bernardo

looks it not like the king  mark it horatio


horatio

most like it harrows me with fear and wonder


bernardo

it would be spoke to


marcellus

question it horatio


horatio

what art thou that usurp this time of night
together with that fair and warlike form
in which the majesty of buried denmark
did sometimes march by heaven i charge thee speak


marcellus

it is offended


bernardo

see it stalks away


horatio

stay speak speak i charge thee speak
exit ghost


marcellus

tis gone and will not answer


bernardo

how now horatio you tremble and look pale
is not this something more than fantasy
what think you ont


horatio

before my god i might not this believe
without the sensible and true avouch
of mine own eyes


marcellus

is it not like the king


horatio

as thou art to thyself
such was the very armour he had on
when he the ambitious norway combated
so frown he once when in an angry parle
he smote the sledded polacks on the ice
tis strange


marcellus

thus twice before and jump at this dead hour
with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch


horatio

in what particular thought to work i know not
but in the gross and scope of my opinion
this bodes some strange eruption to our state


marcellus

good now sit down and tell me he that knows
why this same strict and most observant watch
so nightly toils the subject of the land
and why such daily cast of brazen cannon
and foreign mart for implements of war
why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task
does not divide the sunday from the week
what might be toward that this sweaty haste
doth make the night joint-labourer with the day
who ist that can inform me


horatio

that can i
at least the whisper goes so our last king
whose image even but now appear to us
was as you know by fortinbras of norway
thereto prick on by a most emulate pride
dared to the combat in which our valiant hamlet 
for so this side of our known world esteem him 
did slay this fortinbras who by a seal compact
well ratified by law and heraldry
did forfeit with his life all those his lands
which he stood seized of to the conqueror
against the which a moiety competent
was gaged by our king which had return
to the inheritance of fortinbras
had he been vanquisher as by the same covenant
and carriage of the article design
his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras
of unimproved mettle hot and full
hath in the skirts of norway here and there
shark up a list of lawless resolutes
for food and diet to some enterprise
that hath a stomach int which is no other 
as it doth well appear unto our state 
but to recover of us by strong hand
and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands
so by his father lost and this i take it
is the main motive of our preparations
the source of this our watch and the chief head
of this post-haste and romage in the land


bernardo

i think it be no other but een so
well may it sort that this portentous figure
comes armed through our watch so like the king
that was and is the question of these wars


horatio

a mote it is to trouble the mind eye
in the most high and palmy state of rome
a little ere the mightiest julius fell
the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
did squeak and gibber in the roman streets
as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
disasters in the sun and the moist star
upon whose influence neptune empire stands
was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse
and even the like precurse of fierce events
as harbingers preceding still the fates
and prologue to the omen coming on
have heaven and earth together demonstrated
unto our climatures and countrymen 
but soft behold lo where it comes again
re-enter ghost
ill cross it though it blast me stay illusion
if thou hast any sound or use of voice
speak to me
if there be any good thing to be done
that may to thee do ease and grace to me
speak to me
cock crows
if thou art privy to thy country fate
which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak
or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
extorted treasure in the womb of earth
for which they say you spirits oft walk in death
speak of it stay and speak stop it marcellus


marcellus

shall i strike at it with my partisan


horatio

do if it will not stand


bernardo

tis here


horatio

tis here


marcellus

tis gone
exit ghost
we do it wrong being so majestical
to offer it the show of violence
for it is as the air invulnerable
and our vain blows malicious mockery


bernardo

it was about to speak when the cock crew


horatio

and then it started like a guilty thing
upon a fearful summons i have heard
the cock that is the trumpet to the morn
doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
awake the god of day and at his warning
whether in sea or fire in earth or air
the extravagant and erring spirit hies
to his confine and of the truth herein
this present object made probation


marcellus

it faded on the crowing of the cock
some say that ever gainst that season comes
wherein our saviour birth is celebrated
the bird of dawning singeth all night long
and then they say no spirit dares stir abroad
the nights are wholesome then no planets strike
no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm
so hallow and so gracious is the time


horatio

so have i heard and do in part believe it
but look the morn in russet mantle clad
walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill
break we our watch up and by my advice
let us impart what we have seen to-night
unto young hamlet for upon my life
this spirit dumb to us will speak to him
do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
as needful in our loves fitting our duty


marcellus

let dot i pray and i this morning know
where we shall find him most conveniently

scene ii a room of state in the castle

enter king claudius queen gertrude hamlet  polonius laertes voltimand cornelius lords and attendants


king claudius

though yet of hamlet our dear brother death
the memory be green and that it us befitted
to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
to be contracted in one brow of woe
yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
that we with wisest sorrow think on him
together with remembrance of ourselves
therefore our sometime sister now our queen
the imperial jointress to this warlike state
have we as twere with a defeated joy 
with an auspicious and a dropping eye
with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage
in equal scale weighing delight and dole 
taken to wife nor have we herein barr
your better wisdoms which have freely gone
with this affair along for all our thanks
now follows that you know young fortinbras
holding a weak supposal of our worth
or thinking by our late dear brother death
our state to be disjoint and out of frame
colleagued with the dream of his advantage
he hath not fail to pester us with message
importing the surrender of those lands
lost by his father with all bonds of law
to our most valiant brother so much for him
now for ourself and for this time of meeting
thus much the business is we have here writ
to norway uncle of young fortinbras 
who impotent and bed-rid scarcely hears
of this his nephew purpose to suppress
his further gait herein in that the levies
the lists and full proportions are all made
out of his subject and we here dispatch
you good cornelius and you voltimand
for bearers of this greeting to old norway
giving to you no further personal power
to business with the king more than the scope
of these delated articles allow
farewell and let your haste commend your duty


cornelius

voltimand

in that and all things will we show our duty


king claudius

we doubt it nothing heartily farewell
exeunt voltimand and cornelius
and now laertes what the news with you
you told us of some suit what ist laertes
you cannot speak of reason to the dane
and loose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes
that shall not be my offer not thy asking
the head is not more native to the heart
the hand more instrumental to the mouth
than is the throne of denmark to thy father
what wouldst thou have laertes


laertes

my dread lord
your leave and favour to return to france
from whence though willingly i came to denmark
to show my duty in your coronation
yet now i must confess that duty done
my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france
and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon


king claudius

have you your father leave what says polonius


lord polonius

he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave
by laboursome petition and at last
upon his will i seal my hard consent
i do beseech you give him leave to go


king claudius

take thy fair hour laertes time be thine
and thy best graces spend it at thy will
but now my cousin hamlet and my son 


hamlet

aside  a little more than kin and less than kind


king claudius

how is it that the clouds still hang on you


hamlet

not so my lord i am too much i the sun


queen gertrude

good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off
and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark
do not for ever with thy vailed lids
seek for thy noble father in the dust
thou know tis common all that lives must die
passing through nature to eternity


hamlet

ay madam it is common


queen gertrude

if it be
why seems it so particular with thee


hamlet

seems madam nay it is i know not eems
tis not alone my inky cloak good mother
nor customary suits of solemn black
nor windy suspiration of forced breath
no nor the fruitful river in the eye
nor the dejected havior of the visage
together with all forms moods shapes of grief
that can denote me truly these indeed seem
for they are actions that a man might play
but i have that within which passeth show
these but the trappings and the suits of woe


king claudius

tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet
to give these mourning duties to your father
but you must know your father lost a father
that father lost lost his and the survivor bound
in filial obligation for some term
to do obsequious sorrow but to persever
in obstinate condolement is a course
of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief
it shows a will most incorrect to heaven
a heart unfortified a mind impatient
an understanding simple and unschool
for what we know must be and is as common
as any the most vulgar thing to sense
why should we in our peevish opposition
take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven
a fault against the dead a fault to nature
to reason most absurd whose common theme
is death of fathers and who still hath cried
from the first corse till he that died to-day
this must be so we pray you throw to earth
this unprevailing woe and think of us
as of a father for let the world take note
you are the most immediate to our throne
and with no less nobility of love
than that which dearest father bears his son
do i impart toward you for your intent
in going back to school in wittenberg
it is most retrograde to our desire
and we beseech you bend you to remain
here in the cheer and comfort of our eye
our chiefest courtier cousin and our son


queen gertrude

let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet
i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg


hamlet

i shall in all my best obey you madam


king claudius

why tis a loving and a fair reply
be as ourself in denmark madam come
this gentle and unforced accord of hamlet
sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof
no jocund health that denmark drinks to-day
but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell
and the king rouse the heavens all bruit again
re-speaking earthly thunder come away
exeunt all but hamlet


hamlet

o that this too too solid flesh would melt
thaw and resolve itself into a dew
or that the everlasting had not fix
his canon gainst self-slaughter o god god
how weary stale flat and unprofitable
seem to me all the uses of this world
fie ont ah fie tis an unweeded garden
that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature
possess it merely that it should come to this
but two months dead nay not so much not two
so excellent a king that was to this
hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother
that he might not beteem the winds of heaven
visit her face too roughly heaven and earth
must i remember why she would hang on him
as if increase of appetite had grown
by what it fed on and yet within a month 
let me not think ont frailty thy name is woman 
a little month or ere those shoes were old
with which she follow my poor father body
like niobe all tears why she even she 
o god a beast that wants discourse of reason
would have mourn longer married with my uncle
my father brother but no more like my father
than i to hercules within a month
ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
had left the flushing in her galled eyes
she married o most wicked speed to post
with such dexterity to incestuous sheets
it is not nor it cannot come to good
but break my heart for i must hold my tongue

hamlet

horatio

two nights together had these gentlemen
marcellus and bernardo on their watch
in the dead vast and middle of the night
been thus encounter a figure like your father
armed at point exactly cap-a-pe
appears before them and with solemn march
goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk
by their oppress and fear-surprised eyes
within his truncheon length whilst they distilled
almost to jelly with the act of fear
stand dumb and speak not to him this to me
in dreadful secrecy impart they did
and i with them the third night kept the watch
where as they had deliver both in time
form of the thing each word made true and good
the apparition comes i knew your father
these hands are not more like


hamlet

but where was this


marcellus

my lord upon the platform where we watch


hamlet

did you not speak to it


horatio

my lord i did
but answer made it none yet once methought
it lifted up its head and did address
itself to motion like as it would speak
but even then the morning cock crew loud
and at the sound it shrunk in haste away
and vanish from our sight


hamlet

tis very strange


horatio

as i do live my honour lord tis true
and we did think it writ down in our duty
to let you know of it


hamlet

indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me
hold you the watch to-night


marcellus

bernardo

we do my lord


hamlet

a sable silver


hamlet

hamlet

and bid me hold my peace i pray you all

exit

scene iii a room in polonius house

enter laertes and ophelia


laertes

my necessaries are embark farewell
and sister as the winds give benefit
and convoy is assistant do not sleep
but let me hear from you


ophelia

do you doubt that


laertes

for hamlet and the trifling of his favour
hold it a fashion and a toy in blood
a violet in the youth of primy nature
forward not permanent sweet not lasting
the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more


ophelia

no more but so


laertes

think it no more
for nature crescent does not grow alone
in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes
the inward service of the mind and soul
grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now
and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
the virtue of his will but you must fear
his greatness weigh his will is not his own
for he himself is subject to his birth
he may not as unvalued persons do
carve for himself for on his choice depends
the safety and health of this whole state
and therefore must his choice be circumscribed
unto the voice and yielding of that body
whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you
it fits your wisdom so far to believe it
as he in his particular act and place
may give his saying deed which is no further
than the main voice of denmark goes withal
then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
if with too credent ear you list his songs
or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open
to his unmaster importunity
fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister
and keep you in the rear of your affection
out of the shot and danger of desire
the chariest maid is prodigal enough
if she unmask her beauty to the moon
virtue itself capes not calumnious strokes
the canker galls the infants of the spring
too oft before their buttons be disclosed
and in the morn and liquid dew of youth
contagious blastments are most imminent
be wary then best safety lies in fear
youth to itself rebels though none else near


ophelia

i shall the effect of this good lesson keep
as watchman to my heart but good my brother
do not as some ungracious pastors do
show me the steep and thorny way to heaven
whiles like a puff and reckless libertine
himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
and recks not his own rede


laertes

o fear me not
i stay too long but here my father comes
enter polonius
a double blessing is a double grace
occasion smiles upon a second leave


lord polonius

yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame
the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail
and you are stay for there my blessing with thee
and these few precepts in thy memory
see thou character give thy thoughts no tongue
nor any unproportioned thought his act
be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
those friends thou hast and their adoption tried
grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel
but do not dull thy palm with entertainment
of each new-hatch unfledged comrade beware
of entrance to a quarrel but being in
beart that the opposed may beware of thee
give every man thy ear but few thy voice
take each man censure but reserve thy judgment
costly thy habit as thy purse can buy
but not express in fancy rich not gaudy
for the apparel oft proclaims the man
and they in france of the best rank and station
are of a most select and generous chief in that
neither a borrower nor a lender be
for loan oft loses both itself and friend
and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
this above all to thine ownself be true
and it must follow as the night the day
thou canst not then be false to any man
farewell my blessing season this in thee


laertes

most humbly do i take my leave my lord


lord polonius

the time invites you go your servants tend


laertes

farewell ophelia and remember well
what i have said to you


ophelia

tis in my memory lock
and you yourself shall keep the key of it


laertes

farewell
exit


lord polonius

what ist ophelia be hath said to you


ophelia

so please you something touching the lord hamlet


lord polonius

marry well bethought
tis told me he hath very oft of late
given private time to you and you yourself
have of your audience been most free and bounteous
if it be so as so tis put on me
and that in way of caution i must tell you
you do not understand yourself so clearly
as it behoves my daughter and your honour
what is between you give me up the truth


ophelia

he hath my lord of late made many tenders
of his affection to me


lord polonius

affection pooh you speak like a green girl
unsifted in such perilous circumstance
do you believe his tenders as you call them


ophelia

i do not know my lord what i should think


lord polonius

marry ill teach you think yourself a baby
that you have taen these tenders for true pay
which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly
or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase
running it thus youll tender me a fool


ophelia

my lord he hath importuned me with love
in honourable fashion


lord polonius

ay fashion you may call it go to go to


ophelia

and hath given countenance to his speech my lord
with almost all the holy vows of heaven


lord polonius

ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know
when the blood burns how prodigal the soul
lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter
giving more light than heat extinct in both
even in their promise as it is a-making
you must not take for fire from this time
be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence
set your entreatments at a higher rate
than a command to parley for lord hamlet
believe so much in him that he is young
and with a larger tether may he walk
than may be given you in few ophelia
do not believe his vows for they are brokers
not of that dye which their investments show
but mere implorators of unholy suits
breathing like sanctified and pious bawds
the better to beguile this is for all
i would not in plain terms from this time forth
have you so slander any moment leisure
as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet
look tot i charge you come your ways


ophelia

i shall obey my lord
exeunt

scene iv the platform

enter hamlet horatio and marcellus


hamlet

the air bites shrewdly it is very cold


horatio

it is a nipping and an eager air


hamlet

what hour now


horatio

i think it lacks of twelve


hamlet

no it is struck


horatio

indeed i heard it not then it draws near the season
wherein the spirit held his wont to walk
a flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within
what does this mean my lord


hamlet

the king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse
keeps wassail and the swaggering up-spring reels
and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down
the kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
the triumph of his pledge


horatio

is it a custom


hamlet

ay marry ist
but to my mind though i am native here
and to the manner born it is a custom
more honour in the breach than the observance
this heavy-headed revel east and west
makes us traduced and tax of other nations
they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase
soil our addition and indeed it takes
from our achievements though perform at height
the pith and marrow of our attribute
so oft it chances in particular men
that for some vicious mole of nature in them
as in their birth wherein they are not guilty
since nature cannot choose his origin 
by the oergrowth of some complexion
oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason
or by some habit that too much oer-leavens
the form of plausive manners that these men
carrying i say the stamp of one defect
being nature livery or fortune star 
their virtues else be they as pure as grace
as infinite as man may undergo 
shall in the general censure take corruption
from that particular fault the dram of eale
doth all the noble substance of a doubt
to his own scandal


horatio

look my lord it comes
enter ghost


hamlet

angels and ministers of grace defend us
be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn
bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell
be thy intents wicked or charitable
thou comest in such a questionable shape
that i will speak to thee ill call thee hamlet
king father royal dane o answer me
let me not burst in ignorance but tell
why thy canonized bones hearsed in death
have burst their cerements why the sepulchre
wherein we saw thee quietly inurn
hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws
to cast thee up again what may this mean
that thou dead corse again in complete steel
revisit thus the glimpses of the moon
making night hideous and we fools of nature
so horridly to shake our disposition
with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls
say why is this wherefore what should we do
ghost beckons hamlet


horatio

it beckons you to go away with it
as if it some impartment did desire
to you alone


marcellus

look with what courteous action
it waves you to a more removed ground
but do not go with it


horatio

no by no means


hamlet

it will not speak then i will follow it


horatio

do not my lord


hamlet

why what should be the fear
i do not set my life in a pin fee
and for my soul what can it do to that
being a thing immortal as itself
it waves me forth again ill follow it


horatio

what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord
or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
that beetles oer his base into the sea
and there assume some other horrible form
which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
and draw you into madness think of it
the very place puts toys of desperation
without more motive into every brain
that looks so many fathoms to the sea
and hears it roar beneath


hamlet

it waves me still
go on ill follow thee


marcellus

you shall not go my lord


hamlet

hold off your hands


horatio

be ruled you shall not go


hamlet

my fate cries out
and makes each petty artery in this body
as hardy as the nemean lion nerve
still am i call unhand me gentlemen
by heaven ill make a ghost of him that lets me
i say away go on ill follow thee
exeunt ghost and hamlet


horatio

he waxes desperate with imagination


marcellus

let follow tis not fit thus to obey him


horatio

have after to what issue will this come


marcellus

something is rotten in the state of denmark


horatio

heaven will direct it


marcellus

nay let follow him
exeunt

scene v another part of the platform

enter ghost and hamlet


hamlet

where wilt thou lead me speak ill go no further


ghost

mark me


hamlet

i will


ghost

my hour is almost come
when i to sulphurous and tormenting flames
must render up myself


hamlet

alas poor ghost


ghost

pity me not but lend thy serious hearing
to what i shall unfold


hamlet

speak i am bound to hear


ghost

so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear


hamlet

what


ghost

i am thy father spirit
doom for a certain term to walk the night
and for the day confined to fast in fires
till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
are burnt and purged away but that i am forbid
to tell the secrets of my prison-house
i could a tale unfold whose lightest word
would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood
make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres
thy knotted and combined locks to part
and each particular hair to stand on end
like quills upon the fretful porpentine
but this eternal blazon must not be
to ears of flesh and blood list list o list
if thou didst ever thy dear father love 


hamlet

o god


ghost

revenge his foul and most unnatural murder


hamlet

murder


ghost

murder most foul as in the best it is
but this most foul strange and unnatural


hamlet

haste me to knowt that i with wings as swift
as meditation or the thoughts of love
may sweep to my revenge


ghost

i find thee apt
and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
that roots itself in ease on lethe wharf
wouldst thou not stir in this now hamlet hear
tis given out that sleeping in my orchard
a serpent stung me so the whole ear of denmark
is by a forged process of my death
rankly abused but know thou noble youth
the serpent that did sting thy father life
now wears his crown


hamlet

o my prophetic soul my uncle


ghost

ay that incestuous that adulterate beast
with witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts 
o wicked wit and gifts that have the power
so to seduce won to his shameful lust
the will of my most seeming-virtuous queen
o hamlet what a falling-off was there
from me whose love was of that dignity
that it went hand in hand even with the vow
i made to her in marriage and to decline
upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
to those of mine
but virtue as it never will be moved
though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven
so lust though to a radiant angel link
will sate itself in a celestial bed
and prey on garbage
but soft methinks i scent the morning air
brief let me be sleeping within my orchard
my custom always of the afternoon
upon my secure hour thy uncle stole
with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial
and in the porches of my ears did pour
the leperous distilment whose effect
holds such an enmity with blood of man
that swift as quicksilver it courses through
the natural gates and alleys of the body
and with a sudden vigour doth posset
and curd like eager droppings into milk
the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine
and a most instant tetter bark about
most lazar-like with vile and loathsome crust
all my smooth body
thus was i sleeping by a brother hand
of life of crown of queen at once dispatch
cut off even in the blossoms of my sin
unhousel disappointed unanel
no reckoning made but sent to my account
with all my imperfections on my head
o horrible o horrible most horrible
if thou hast nature in thee bear it not
let not the royal bed of denmark be
a couch for luxury and damned incest
but howsoever thou pursuest this act
taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive
against thy mother aught leave her to heaven
and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
to prick and sting her fare thee well at once
the glow-worm shows the matin to be near
and gins to pale his uneffectual fire
adieu adieu hamlet remember me
exit


hamlet

o all you host of heaven o earth what else
and shall i couple hell o fie hold hold my heart
and you my sinews grow not instant old
but bear me stiffly up remember thee
ay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat
in this distracted globe remember thee
yea from the table of my memory
ill wipe away all trivial fond records
all saws of books all forms all pressures past
that youth and observation copied there
and thy commandment all alone shall live
within the book and volume of my brain
unmix with baser matter yes by heaven
o most pernicious woman
o villain villain smiling damned villain
my tables meet it is i set it down
that one may smile and smile and be a villain
at least im sure it may be so in denmark
writing

act ii
scene i a room in polonius house

enter polonius and reynaldo


lord polonius

give him this money and these notes reynaldo


reynaldo

i will my lord


lord polonius

you shall do marvellous wisely good reynaldo
before you visit him to make inquire
of his behavior


reynaldo

my lord i did intend it


lord polonius

marry well said very well said look you sir
inquire me first what danskers are in paris
and how and who what means and where they keep
what company at what expense and finding
by this encompassment and drift of question
that they do know my son come you more nearer
than your particular demands will touch it
take you as twere some distant knowledge of him
as thus i know his father and his friends
and in part him  do you mark this reynaldo


reynaldo

ay very well my lord


lord polonius

and in part him but you may say not well
but ift be he i mean he very wild
addicted so and so and there put on him
what forgeries you please marry none so rank
as may dishonour him take heed of that
but sir such wanton wild and usual slips
as are companions noted and most known
to youth and liberty


reynaldo

as gaming my lord


lord polonius

ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling
drabbing you may go so far


reynaldo

my lord that would dishonour him


lord polonius

faith no as you may season it in the charge
you must not put another scandal on him
that he is open to incontinency
that not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly
that they may seem the taints of liberty
the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind
a savageness in unreclaimed blood
of general assault


reynaldo

but my good lord 


lord polonius

wherefore should you do this


reynaldo

ay my lord
i would know that


lord polonius

marry sir here my drift
and i believe it is a fetch of wit
you laying these slight sullies on my son
as twere a thing a little soil i the working mark you
your party in converse him you would sound
having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
the youth you breathe of guilty be assured
he closes with you in this consequence
good sir or so or friend or gentleman
according to the phrase or the addition
of man and country


reynaldo

very good my lord


lord polonius

and then sir does he this he does what was i
about to say by the mass i was about to say
something where did i leave


reynaldo

at closes in the consequence at friend or so
and gentleman


lord polonius

at closes in the consequence ay marry
he closes thus i know the gentleman
i saw him yesterday or t other day
or then or then with such or such and as you say
there was a gaming there oertook in rouse
there falling out at tennis or perchance
i saw him enter such a house of sale
videlicet a brothel or so forth
see you now
your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth
and thus do we of wisdom and of reach
with windlasses and with assays of bias
by indirections find directions out
so by my former lecture and advice
shall you my son you have me have you not


reynaldo

my lord i have


lord polonius

god be wi you fare you well


reynaldo

good my lord


lord polonius

exit reynaldo
enter ophelia
how now ophelia what the matter


ophelia

o my lord my lord i have been so affrighted


lord polonius

with what i the name of god


ophelia

my lord as i was sewing in my closet
lord hamlet with his doublet all unbraced
no hat upon his head his stockings foul
ungarter and down-gyved to his ancle
pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other
and with a look so piteous in purport
as if he had been loosed out of hell
to speak of horrors he comes before me


lord polonius

mad for thy love


ophelia

my lord i do not know
but truly i do fear it


lord polonius

what said he


ophelia

he took me by the wrist and held me hard
then goes he to the length of all his arm
and with his other hand thus oer his brow
he falls to such perusal of my face
as he would draw it long stay he so
at last a little shaking of mine arm
and thrice his head thus waving up and down
he raised a sigh so piteous and profound
as it did seem to shatter all his bulk
and end his being that done he lets me go
and with his head over his shoulder turn
he seem to find his way without his eyes
for out o doors he went without their helps
and to the last bended their light on me


lord polonius

come go with me i will go seek the king
this is the very ecstasy of love
whose violent property fordoes itself
and leads the will to desperate undertakings
as oft as any passion under heaven
that does afflict our natures i am sorry
what have you given him any hard words of late


ophelia

no my good lord but as you did command
i did repel his fetters and denied
his access to me


lord polonius

that hath made him mad
i am sorry that with better heed and judgment
i had not quoted him i fear he did but trifle
and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy
by heaven it is as proper to our age
to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
as it is common for the younger sort
to lack discretion come go we to the king
this must be known which being kept close might
move
more grief to hide than hate to utter love
exeunt

scene ii a room in the castle

enter king claudius queen gertrude rosencrantz guildenstern and attendants


king claudius

welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern
moreover that we much did long to see you
the need we have to use you did provoke
our hasty sending something have you heard
of hamlet transformation so call it
sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
resembles that it was what it should be
more than his father death that thus hath put him
so much from the understanding of himself
i cannot dream of i entreat you both
that being of so young days brought up with him
and sith so neighbour to his youth and havior
that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
some little time so by your companies
to draw him on to pleasures and to gather
so much as from occasion you may glean
whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
that open lies within our remedy


queen gertrude

good gentlemen he hath much talk of you
and sure i am two men there are not living
to whom he more adheres if it will please you
to show us so much gentry and good will
as to expend your time with us awhile
for the supply and profit of our hope
your visitation shall receive such thanks
as fits a king remembrance


rosencrantz

both your majesties
might by the sovereign power you have of us
put your dread pleasures more into command
than to entreaty


guildenstern

but we both obey
and here give up ourselves in the full bent
to lay our service freely at your feet
to be commanded


king claudius

thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern


queen gertrude

thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz
and i beseech you instantly to visit
my too much changed son go some of you
and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is


guildenstern

heavens make our presence and our practises
pleasant and helpful to him


queen gertrude

ay amen
exeunt rosencrantz guildenstern and some attendants
enter polonius


lord polonius

the ambassadors from norway my good lord
are joyfully return


king claudius

thou still hast been the father of good news


lord polonius

have i my lord i assure my good liege
i hold my duty as i hold my soul
both to my god and to my gracious king
and i do think or else this brain of mine
hunts not the trail of policy so sure
as it hath used to do that i have found
the very cause of hamlet lunacy


king claudius

o speak of that that do i long to hear


lord polonius

give first admittance to the ambassadors
my news shall be the fruit to that great feast


king claudius

thyself do grace to them and bring them in
exit polonius
he tells me my dear gertrude he hath found
the head and source of all your son distemper


queen gertrude

i doubt it is no other but the main
his father death and our oerhasty marriage


king claudius

well we shall sift him
re-enter polonius with voltimand and cornelius
welcome my good friends
say voltimand what from our brother norway


voltimand

most fair return of greetings and desires
upon our first he sent out to suppress
his nephew levies which to him appear
to be a preparation gainst the polack
but better look into he truly found
it was against your highness whereat grieved
that so his sickness age and impotence
was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests
on fortinbras which he in brief obeys
receives rebuke from norway and in fine
makes vow before his uncle never more
to give the assay of arms against your majesty
whereon old norway overcome with joy
gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
and his commission to employ those soldiers
so levied as before against the polack
with an entreaty herein further shown
giving a paper
that it might please you to give quiet pass
through your dominions for this enterprise
on such regards of safety and allowance
as therein are set down


king claudius

it likes us well
and at our more consider time well read
answer and think upon this business
meantime we thank you for your well-took labour
go to your rest at night well feast together
most welcome home
exeunt voltimand and cornelius


lord polonius

this business is well ended
my liege and madam to expostulate
what majesty should be what duty is
why day is day night night and time is time
were nothing but to waste night day and time
therefore since brevity is the soul of wit
and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes
i will be brief your noble son is mad
mad call i it for to define true madness
what ist but to be nothing else but mad
but let that go


queen gertrude

more matter with less art


lord polonius

madam i swear i use no art at all
that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity
and pity tis tis true a foolish figure
but farewell it for i will use no art
mad let us grant him then and now remains
that we find out the cause of this effect
or rather say the cause of this defect
for this effect defective comes by cause
thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend
i have a daughter have while she is mine 
who in her duty and obedience mark
hath given me this now gather and surmise
reads
to the celestial and my soul idol the most
beautified ophelia 
that an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is
a vile phrase but you shall hear thus
reads
in her excellent white bosom these   c


queen gertrude

came this from hamlet to her


lord polonius

good madam stay awhile i will be faithful
reads
oubt thou the stars are fire
doubt that the sun doth move
doubt truth to be a liar
but never doubt i love
o dear ophelia i am ill at these numbers
i have not art to reckon my groans but that
i love thee best o most best believe it adieu
thine evermore most dear lady whilst
this machine is to him hamlet
this in obedience hath my daughter shown me
and more above hath his solicitings
as they fell out by time by means and place
all given to mine ear


king claudius

but how hath she
received his love


lord polonius

what do you think of me


king claudius

as of a man faithful and honourable


lord polonius

i would fain prove so but what might you think
when i had seen this hot love on the wing 
as i perceived it i must tell you that
before my daughter told me what might you
or my dear majesty your queen here think
if i had play the desk or table-book
or given my heart a winking mute and dumb
or look upon this love with idle sight
what might you think no i went round to work
and my young mistress thus i did bespeak
lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star
this must not be and then i precepts gave her
that she should lock herself from his resort
admit no messengers receive no tokens
which done she took the fruits of my advice
and he repulsed a short tale to make 
fell into a sadness then into a fast
thence to a watch thence into a weakness
thence to a lightness and by this declension
into the madness wherein now he raves
and all we mourn for


king claudius

do you think tis this


queen gertrude

it may be very likely


lord polonius

hath there been such a time i fain know that 
that i have positively said tis so
when it proved otherwise


king claudius

not that i know


lord polonius

pointing to his head and shoulder
take this from this if this be otherwise
if circumstances lead me i will find
where truth is hid though it were hid indeed
within the centre


king claudius

how may we try it further


lord polonius

you know sometimes he walks four hours together
here in the lobby


queen gertrude

so he does indeed


lord polonius

at such a time ill loose my daughter to him
be you and i behind an arras then
mark the encounter if he love her not
and be not from his reason falln thereon
let me be no assistant for a state
but keep a farm and carters


king claudius

we will try it


queen gertrude

but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading


lord polonius

away i do beseech you both away
ill board him presently
exeunt king claudius queen gertrude and attendants
enter hamlet reading
o give me leave
how does my good lord hamlet


hamlet

well god-a-mercy


lord polonius

do you know me my lord


hamlet

excellent well you are a fishmonger


lord polonius

not i my lord


hamlet

then i would you were so honest a man


lord polonius

honest my lord


hamlet

ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be
one man picked out of ten thousand


lord polonius

that very true my lord


hamlet

for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a
god kissing carrion have you a daughter


lord polonius

i have my lord


hamlet

let her not walk i the sun conception is a
blessing but not as your daughter may conceive
friend look to t


lord polonius

aside  how say you by that still harping on my
daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i
was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and
truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for
love very near this ill speak to him again
what do you read my lord


hamlet

words words words


lord polonius

what is the matter my lord


hamlet

between who


lord polonius

i mean the matter that you read my lord


hamlet

slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here
that old men have grey beards that their faces are
wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and
plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
wit together with most weak hams all which sir
though i most powerfully and potently believe yet
i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for
yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab
you could go backward


lord polonius

aside  though this be madness yet there is method
in t will you walk out of the air my lord


hamlet

into my grave


lord polonius

indeed that is out o the air
aside
how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness
that often madness hits on which reason and sanity
could not so prosperously be delivered of i will
leave him and suddenly contrive the means of
meeting between him and my daughter my honourable
lord i will most humbly take my leave of you


hamlet

you cannot sir take from me any thing that i will
more willingly part withal except my life except
my life except my life


lord polonius

fare you well my lord


hamlet

these tedious old fools
enter rosencrantz and guildenstern


lord polonius

you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is


rosencrantz

to polonius  god save you sir
exit polonius


guildenstern

my honoured lord


rosencrantz

my most dear lord


hamlet

my excellent good friends how dost thou
guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both


rosencrantz

as the indifferent children of the earth


guildenstern

happy in that we are not over-happy
on fortune cap we are not the very button


hamlet

nor the soles of her shoe


rosencrantz

neither my lord


hamlet

then you live about her waist or in the middle of
her favours


guildenstern

faith her privates we


hamlet

in the secret parts of fortune o most true she
is a strumpet what the news


rosencrantz

none my lord but that the world grown honest


hamlet

then is doomsday near but your news is not true
let me question more in particular what have you
my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune
that she sends you to prison hither


guildenstern

prison my lord


hamlet

denmark a prison


rosencrantz

then is the world one


hamlet

a goodly one in which there are many confines
wards and dungeons denmark being one o the worst


rosencrantz

we think not so my lord


hamlet

why then tis none to you for there is nothing
either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me
it is a prison


rosencrantz

why then your ambition makes it one tis too
narrow for your mind


hamlet

o god i could be bounded in a nut shell and count
myself a king of infinite space were it not that i
have bad dreams


guildenstern

which dreams indeed are ambition for the very
substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream


hamlet

a dream itself is but a shadow


rosencrantz

truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a
quality that it is but a shadow shadow


hamlet

then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and
outstretched heroes the beggars shadows shall we
to the court for by my fay i cannot reason


rosencrantz

guildenstern

well wait upon you


hamlet

no such matter i will not sort you with the rest
of my servants for to speak to you like an honest
man i am most dreadfully attended but in the
beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore


rosencrantz

to visit you my lord no other occasion


hamlet

beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i
thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are
too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it
your own inclining is it a free visitation come
deal justly with me come come nay speak


guildenstern

what should we say my lord


hamlet

why any thing but to the purpose you were sent
for and there is a kind of confession in your looks
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour
i know the good king and queen have sent for you


rosencrantz

to what end my lord


hamlet

that you must teach me but let me conjure you by
the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of
our youth by the obligation of our ever-preserved
love and by what more dear a better proposer could
charge you withal be even and direct with me
whether you were sent for or no


rosencrantz

aside to guildenstern  what say you


hamlet

aside  nay then i have an eye of you if you
love me hold not off


guildenstern

my lord we were sent for


hamlet

i will tell you why so shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king
and queen moult no feather i have of late but
wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all
custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition that this goodly frame the
earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most
excellent canopy the air look you this brave
oerhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted
with golden fire why it appears no other thing to
me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours
what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason
how infinite in faculty in form and moving how
express and admirable in action how like an angel
in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the
world the paragon of animals and yet to me
what is this quintessence of dust man delights not
me no nor woman neither though by your smiling
you seem to say so


rosencrantz

my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts


hamlet

why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me


rosencrantz

to think my lord if you delight not in man what
lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
you we coted them on the way and hither are they
coming to offer you service


hamlet

he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty
shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight
shall use his foil and target the lover shall not
sigh gratis the humourous man shall end his part
in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickled o the sere and the lady shall
say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt
fort what players are they


rosencrantz

even those you were wont to take delight in the
tragedians of the city


hamlet

how chances it they travel their residence both
in reputation and profit was better both ways


rosencrantz

i think their inhibition comes by the means of the
late innovation


hamlet

do they hold the same estimation they did when i was
in the city are they so followed


rosencrantz

no indeed are they not


hamlet

how comes it do they grow rusty


rosencrantz

nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but
there is sir an aery of children little eyases
that cry out on the top of question and are most
tyrannically clapped fort these are now the
fashion and so berattle the common stages so they
call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
goose-quills and dare scarce come thither


hamlet

what are they children who maintains em how are
they escoted will they pursue the quality no
longer than they can sing will they not say
afterwards if they should grow themselves to common
players as it is most like if their means are no
better their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim against their own succession


rosencrantz

faith there has been much to do on both sides and
the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
controversy there was for a while no money bid
for argument unless the poet and the player went to
cuffs in the question


hamlet

ist possible


guildenstern

o there has been much throwing about of brains


hamlet

do the boys carry it away


rosencrantz

ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too


hamlet

it is not very strange for mine uncle is king of
denmark and those that would make mows at him while
my father lived give twenty forty fifty an
hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little
blood there is something in this more than
natural if philosophy could find it out
flourish of trumpets within


guildenstern

there are the players


hamlet

gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands
come then the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb
lest my extent to the players which i tell you
must show fairly outward should more appear like
entertainment than yours you are welcome but my
uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived


guildenstern

in what my dear lord


hamlet

i am but mad north-north-west when the wind is
southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw
enter polonius


lord polonius

well be with you gentlemen


hamlet

hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a
hearer that great baby you see there is not yet
out of his swaddling-clouts


rosencrantz

happily he the second time come to them for they
say an old man is twice a child


hamlet

i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players
mark it you say right sir o monday morning
twas so indeed


lord polonius

my lord i have news to tell you


hamlet

my lord i have news to tell you
when roscius was an actor in rome 


lord polonius

the actors are come hither my lord


hamlet

buz buz


lord polonius

upon mine honour 


hamlet

then came each actor on his ass 


lord polonius

the best actors in the world either for tragedy
comedy history pastoral pastoral-comical
historical-pastoral tragical-historical tragical-
comical-historical-pastoral scene individable or
poem unlimited seneca cannot be too heavy nor
plautus too light for the law of writ and the
liberty these are the only men


hamlet

o jephthah judge of israel what a treasure hadst thou


lord polonius

what a treasure had he my lord


hamlet

why
one fair daughter and no more
the which he loved passing well


lord polonius

aside  still on my daughter


hamlet

am i not i the right old jephthah


lord polonius

if you call me jephthah my lord i have a daughter
that i love passing well


hamlet

nay that follows not


lord polonius

what follows then my lord


hamlet

why
as by lot god wot
and then you know
it came to pass as most like it was 
the first row of the pious chanson will show you
more for look where my abridgement comes
enter four or five players
you are welcome masters welcome all i am glad
to see thee well welcome good friends o my old
friend thy face is valenced since i saw thee last
comest thou to beard me in denmark what my young
lady and mistress byr lady your ladyship is
nearer to heaven than when i saw you last by the
altitude of a chopine pray god your voice like
apiece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the
ring masters you are all welcome well een
tot like french falconers fly at any thing we see
well have a speech straight come give us a taste
of your quality come a passionate speech


first player

what speech my lord


hamlet

i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was
never acted or if it was not above once for the
play i remember pleased not the million twas
caviare to the general but it was as i received
it and others whose judgments in such matters
cried in the top of mine an excellent play well
digested in the scenes set down with as much
modesty as cunning i remember one said there
were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might
indict the author of affectation but called it an
honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very
much more handsome than fine one speech in it i
chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and
thereabout of it especially where he speaks of
priam slaughter if it live in your memory begin
at this line let me see let me see 
the rugged pyrrhus like the hyrcanian beast 
it is not so it begins with pyrrhus 
the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms
black as his purpose did the night resemble
when he lay couched in the ominous horse
hath now this dread and black complexion smear
with heraldry more dismal head to foot
now is he total gules horridly trick
with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons
baked and impasted with the parching streets
that lend a tyrannous and damned light
to their lord murder roasted in wrath and fire
and thus oer-sized with coagulate gore
with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus
old grandsire priam seeks
so proceed you


lord polonius

fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and
good discretion


first player

anon he finds him
striking too short at greeks his antique sword
rebellious to his arm lies where it falls
repugnant to command unequal match
pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide
but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
the unnerved father falls then senseless ilium
seeming to feel this blow with flaming top
stoops to his base and with a hideous crash
takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword
which was declining on the milky head
of reverend priam seem i the air to stick
so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood
and like a neutral to his will and matter
did nothing
but as we often see against some storm
a silence in the heavens the rack stand still
the bold winds speechless and the orb below
as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder
doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause
aroused vengeance sets him new a-work
and never did the cyclops hammers fall
on mars armour forged for proof eterne
with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword
now falls on priam
out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods
in general synod take away her power
break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel
and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven
as low as to the fiends


lord polonius

this is too long


hamlet

it shall to the barber with your beard prithee
say on he for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he
sleeps say on come to hecuba


first player

but who o who had seen the mobled queen 


hamlet

the mobled queen


lord polonius

that good mobled queen is good


first player

run barefoot up and down threatening the flames
with bisson rheum a clout upon that head
where late the diadem stood and for a robe
about her lank and all oer-teemed loins
a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up
who this had seen with tongue in venom steep
gainst fortune state would treason have
pronounced
but if the gods themselves did see her then
when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport
in mincing with his sword her husband limbs
the instant burst of clamour that she made
unless things mortal move them not at all
would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
and passion in the gods


lord polonius

look whether he has not turned his colour and has
tears in eyes pray you no more


hamlet

tis well ill have thee speak out the rest soon
good my lord will you see the players well
bestowed do you hear let them be well used for
they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
time after your death you were better have a bad
epitaph than their ill report while you live


lord polonius

my lord i will use them according to their desert


hamlet

god bodykins man much better use every man
after his desert and who should cape whipping
use them after your own honour and dignity the less
they deserve the more merit is in your bounty
take them in


lord polonius

come sirs


hamlet

follow him friends well hear a play to-morrow
exit polonius with all the players but the first
dost thou hear me old friend can you play the
murder of gonzago


first player

ay my lord


hamlet

well hat to-morrow night you could for a need
study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which
i would set down and insert int could you not


first player

ay my lord


hamlet

very well follow that lord and look you mock him
not
exit first player
my good friends ill leave you till night you are
welcome to elsinore


rosencrantz

good my lord


hamlet

ay so god be wi ye
exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern
now i am alone
o what a rogue and peasant slave am i
is it not monstrous that this player here
but in a fiction in a dream of passion
could force his soul so to his own conceit
that from her working all his visage wann
tears in his eyes distraction in aspect
a broken voice and his whole function suiting
with forms to his conceit and all for nothing
for hecuba
what hecuba to him or he to hecuba
that he should weep for her what would he do
had he the motive and the cue for passion
that i have he would drown the stage with tears
and cleave the general ear with horrid speech
make mad the guilty and appal the free
confound the ignorant and amaze indeed
the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i
a dull and muddy-mettled rascal peak
like john-a-dreams unpregnant of my cause
and can say nothing no not for a king
upon whose property and most dear life
a damn defeat was made am i a coward
who calls me villain breaks my pate across
plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i the throat
as deep as to the lungs who does me this
ha
wounds i should take it for it cannot be
but i am pigeon-liver and lack gall
to make oppression bitter or ere this
i should have fatted all the region kites
with this slave offal bloody bawdy villain
remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain
o vengeance
why what an ass am i this is most brave
that i the son of a dear father murder
prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell
must like a whore unpack my heart with words
and fall a-cursing like a very drab
a scullion
fie upont foh about my brain i have heard
that guilty creatures sitting at a play
have by the very cunning of the scene
been struck so to the soul that presently
they have proclaim their malefactions
for murder though it have no tongue will speak
with most miraculous organ ill have these players
play something like the murder of my father
before mine uncle ill observe his looks
ill tent him to the quick if he but blench
i know my course the spirit that i have seen
may be the devil and the devil hath power
to assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps
out of my weakness and my melancholy
as he is very potent with such spirits
abuses me to damn me ill have grounds
more relative than this the play  the thing
wherein ill catch the conscience of the king

act iii
scene i a room in the castle

enter king claudius queen gertrude polonius ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern


king claudius

and can you by no drift of circumstance
get from him why he puts on this confusion
grating so harshly all his days of quiet
with turbulent and dangerous lunacy


rosencrantz

he does confess he feels himself distracted
but from what cause he will by no means speak


guildenstern

nor do we find him forward to be sounded
but with a crafty madness keeps aloof
when we would bring him on to some confession
of his true state


queen gertrude

did he receive you well


rosencrantz

most like a gentleman


guildenstern

but with much forcing of his disposition


rosencrantz

niggard of question but of our demands
most free in his reply


queen gertrude

did you assay him
to any pastime


rosencrantz

madam it so fell out that certain players
we oer-raught on the way of these we told him
and there did seem in him a kind of joy
to hear of it they are about the court
and as i think they have already order
this night to play before him


lord polonius

tis most true
and he beseech me to entreat your majesties
to hear and see the matter


king claudius

with all my heart and it doth much content me
to hear him so inclined
good gentlemen give him a further edge
and drive his purpose on to these delights


rosencrantz

we shall my lord
exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern


king claudius

sweet gertrude leave us too
for we have closely sent for hamlet hither
that he as twere by accident may here
affront ophelia
her father and myself lawful espials
will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen
we may of their encounter frankly judge
and gather by him as he is behaved
if t be the affliction of his love or no
that thus he suffers for


queen gertrude

i shall obey you
and for your part ophelia i do wish
that your good beauties be the happy cause
of hamlet wildness so shall i hope your virtues
will bring him to his wonted way again
to both your honours


ophelia

madam i wish it may
exit queen gertrude


lord polonius

ophelia walk you here gracious so please you
we will bestow ourselves
to ophelia
read on this book
that show of such an exercise may colour
your loneliness we are oft to blame in this 
tis too much proved that with devotion visage
and pious action we do sugar oer
the devil himself


king claudius

aside          o tis too true
how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience
the harlot cheek beautied with plastering art
is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
than is my deed to my most painted word
o heavy burthen


lord polonius

i hear him coming let withdraw my lord
exeunt king claudius and polonius
enter hamlet


hamlet

to be or not to be that is the question
whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
or to take arms against a sea of troubles
and by opposing end them to die to sleep
no more and by a sleep to say we end
the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to tis a consummation
devoutly to be wish to die to sleep
to sleep perchance to dream ay there the rub
for in that sleep of death what dreams may come
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil
must give us pause there the respect
that makes calamity of so long life
for who would bear the whips and scorns of time
the oppressor wrong the proud man contumely
the pangs of despised love the law delay
the insolence of office and the spurns
that patient merit of the unworthy takes
when he himself might his quietus make
with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear
to grunt and sweat under a weary life
but that the dread of something after death
the undiscover country from whose bourn
no traveller returns puzzles the will
and makes us rather bear those ills we have
than fly to others that we know not of
thus conscience does make cowards of us all
and thus the native hue of resolution
is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought
and enterprises of great pith and moment
with this regard their currents turn awry
and lose the name of action soft you now
the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons
be all my sins remember


ophelia

good my lord
how does your honour for this many a day


hamlet

i humbly thank you well well well


ophelia

my lord i have remembrances of yours
that i have longed long to re-deliver
i pray you now receive them


hamlet

no not i
i never gave you aught


ophelia

my honour lord you know right well you did
and with them words of so sweet breath composed
as made the things more rich their perfume lost
take these again for to the noble mind
rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind
there my lord


hamlet

ha ha are you honest


ophelia

my lord


hamlet

are you fair


ophelia

what means your lordship


hamlet

that if you be honest and fair your honesty should
admit no discourse to your beauty


ophelia

could beauty my lord have better commerce than
with honesty


hamlet

ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner
transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
force of honesty can translate beauty into his
likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the
time gives it proof i did love you once


ophelia

indeed my lord you made me believe so


hamlet

you should not have believed me for virtue cannot
so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
it i loved you not


ophelia

i was the more deceived


hamlet

get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a
breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest
but yet i could accuse me of such things that it
were better my mother had not borne me i am very
proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at
my beck than i have thoughts to put them in
imagination to give them shape or time to act them
in what should such fellows as i do crawling
between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves
all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery
where your father


ophelia

at home my lord


hamlet

let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the
fool no where but in own house farewell


ophelia

o help him you sweet heavens


hamlet

if thou dost marry ill give thee this plague for
thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as
snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a
nunnery go farewell or if thou wilt needs
marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them to a nunnery go
and quickly too farewell


ophelia

o heavenly powers restore him


hamlet

i have heard of your paintings too well enough god
has given you one face and you make yourselves
another you jig you amble and you lisp and
nick-name god creatures and make your wantonness
your ignorance go to ill no more ont it hath
made me mad i say we will have no more marriages
those that are married already all but one shall
live the rest shall keep as they are to a
nunnery go

o what a noble mind is here oerthrown
the courtier soldier scholar eye tongue sword
the expectancy and rose of the fair state
the glass of fashion and the mould of form
the observed of all observers quite quite down
and i of ladies most deject and wretched
that suck the honey of his music vows
now see that noble and most sovereign reason
like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh
that unmatch form and feature of blown youth
blasted with ecstasy o woe is me

re-enter king claudius and polonius


king claudius

love his affections do not that way tend
nor what he spake though it lack form a little
was not like madness there something in his soul
oer which his melancholy sits on brood
and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose
will be some danger which for to prevent
i have in quick determination
thus set it down he shall with speed to england
for the demand of our neglected tribute
haply the seas and countries different
with variable objects shall expel
this something-settled matter in his heart
whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
from fashion of himself what think you ont


lord polonius

it shall do well but yet do i believe
the origin and commencement of his grief
sprung from neglected love how now ophelia
you need not tell us what lord hamlet said
we heard it all my lord do as you please
but if you hold it fit after the play
let his queen mother all alone entreat him
to show his grief let her be round with him
and ill be placed so please you in the ear
of all their conference if she find him not
to england send him or confine him where
your wisdom best shall think

you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it
as many of your players do i had as lief the
town-crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand thus but use all gently
for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say
the whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness o it
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to
very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who
for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumbshows and noise i would have such
a fellow whipped for oerdoing termagant it

i warrant your honour


hamlet

be not too tame neither but let your own discretion
be your tutor suit the action to the word the
word to the action with this special oerstep not
the modesty of nature for any thing so overdone is
from the purpose of playing whose end both at the
first and now was and is to hold as twere the
mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature
scorn her own image and the very age and body of
the time his form and pressure now this overdone
or come tardy off though it make the unskilful
laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the
censure of the which one must in your allowance
oerweigh a whole theatre of others o there be
players that i have seen play and heard others
praise and that highly not to speak it profanely
that neither having the accent of christians nor
the gait of christian pagan nor man have so
strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of
nature journeymen had made men and not made them
well they imitated humanity so abominably


first player

i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us
sir


hamlet

o reform it altogether and let those that play
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them
for there be of them that will themselves laugh to
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too though in the mean time some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered

do not itself unkennel in one speech
it is a damned ghost that we have seen

ay or any show that youll show him be not you

here stooping to your clemency
we beg your hearing patiently
exit


hamlet

is this a prologue or the posy of a ring


ophelia

tis brief my lord


hamlet

as woman love
enter two players king and queen


player king

full thirty times hath phoebus cart gone round
neptune salt wash and tellus orbed ground
and thirty dozen moons with borrow sheen
about the world have times twelve thirties been
since love our hearts and hymen did our hands
unite commutual in most sacred bands


player queen

so many journeys may the sun and moon
make us again count oer ere love be done
but woe is me you are so sick of late
so far from cheer and from your former state
that i distrust you yet though i distrust
discomfort you my lord it nothing must
for women fear and love holds quantity
in neither aught or in extremity
now what my love is proof hath made you know
and as my love is sized my fear is so
where love is great the littlest doubts are fear
where little fears grow great great love grows there


player king

faith i must leave thee love and shortly too
my operant powers their functions leave to do
and thou shalt live in this fair world behind
honour beloved and haply one as kind
for husband shalt thou 


player queen

o confound the rest
such love must needs be treason in my breast
in second husband let me be accurst
none wed the second but who kill the first


hamlet

aside  wormwood wormwood


player queen

the instances that second marriage move
are base respects of thrift but none of love
a second time i kill my husband dead
when second husband kisses me in bed


player king

i do believe you think what now you speak
but what we do determine oft we break
purpose is but the slave to memory
of violent birth but poor validity
which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree
but fall unshaken when they mellow be
most necessary tis that we forget
to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt
what to ourselves in passion we propose
the passion ending doth the purpose lose
the violence of either grief or joy
their own enactures with themselves destroy
where joy most revels grief doth most lament
grief joys joy grieves on slender accident
this world is not for aye nor tis not strange
that even our loves should with our fortunes change
for tis a question left us yet to prove
whether love lead fortune or else fortune love
the great man down you mark his favourite flies
the poor advanced makes friends of enemies
and hitherto doth love on fortune tend
for who not needs shall never lack a friend
and who in want a hollow friend doth try
directly seasons him his enemy
but orderly to end where i begun
our wills and fates do so contrary run
that our devices still are overthrown
our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own
so think thou wilt no second husband wed
but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead


player queen

nor earth to me give food nor heaven light
sport and repose lock from me day and night
to desperation turn my trust and hope
an anchor cheer in prison be my scope
each opposite that blanks the face of joy
meet what i would have well and it destroy
both here and hence pursue me lasting strife
if once a widow ever i be wife


hamlet

if she should break it now


player king

tis deeply sworn sweet leave me here awhile
my spirits grow dull and fain i would beguile
the tedious day with sleep
sleeps


player queen

sleep rock thy brain
and never come mischance between us twain

madam how like you this play

choice italian you shall see anon how the murderer
gets the love of gonzago wife

provincial roses on my razed shoes get me a

hamlet

with drink sir


guildenstern

no my lord rather with choler


hamlet

your wisdom should show itself more richer to
signify this to his doctor for for me to put him
to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
more choler


guildenstern

good my lord put your discourse into some frame and
start not so wildly from my affair


hamlet

i am tame sir pronounce


guildenstern

spirit hath sent me to you

into amazement and admiration


hamlet

rosencrantz

go to bed


hamlet

we shall obey were she ten times our mother have
you any further trade with us


rosencrantz

my lord you once did love me


hamlet

so i do still by these pickers and stealers


rosencrantz

good my lord what is your cause of distemper you
do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if
you deny your griefs to your friend


hamlet

sir i lack advancement


rosencrantz

how can that be when you have the voice of the king
himself for your succession in denmark


hamlet

ay but sir while the grass grows the proverb
is something musty
re-enter players with recorders
o the recorders let me see one to withdraw with
you why do you go about to recover the wind of me
as if you would drive me into a toil


guildenstern

unmannerly


hamlet

this pipe


guildenstern

your lingers and thumb give it breath with your
mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music
look you these are the stops


guildenstern

but these cannot i command to any utterance of
harmony i have not the skill


hamlet

why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of
me you would play upon me you would seem to know
my stops you would pluck out the heart of my
mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to
the top of my compass and there is much music
excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot
you make it speak blood do you think i am
easier to be played on than a pipe call me what
instrument you will though you can fret me yet you
cannot play upon me

to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
are mortised and adjoin which when it falls
each small annexment petty consequence
attends the boisterous ruin never alone
did the king sigh but with a general groan

thanks dear my lord
exit polonius
o my offence is rank it smells to heaven
it hath the primal eldest curse upont
a brother murder pray can i not
though inclination be as sharp as will
my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent
and like a man to double business bound
i stand in pause where i shall first begin
and both neglect what if this cursed hand
were thicker than itself with brother blood
is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
to wash it white as snow whereto serves mercy
but to confront the visage of offence
and what in prayer but this two-fold force
to be forestalled ere we come to fall
or pardon being down then ill look up
my fault is past but o what form of prayer
can serve my turn forgive me my foul murder
that cannot be since i am still possess
of those effects for which i did the murder
my crown mine own ambition and my queen
may one be pardon and retain the offence
in the corrupted currents of this world
offence gilded hand may shove by justice
and oft tis seen the wicked prize itself
buys out the law but tis not so above
there is no shuffling there the action lies
in his true nature and we ourselves compell
even to the teeth and forehead of our faults
to give in evidence what then what rests
try what repentance can what can it not
yet what can it when one can not repent
o wretched state o bosom black as death
o limed soul that struggling to be free
art more engaged help angels make assay
bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel
be soft as sinews of the newborn babe
all may be well
retires and kneels

now might i do it pat now he is praying
and now ill dot and so he goes to heaven
and so am i revenged that would be scann
a villain kills my father and for that

to heaven
o this is hire and salary not revenge
he took my father grossly full of bread
with all his crimes broad blown as flush as may
and how his audit stands who knows save heaven
but in our circumstance and course of thought
tis heavy with him and am i then revenged
to take him in the purging of his soul
when he is fit and season for his passage
no
up sword and know thou a more horrid hent
when he is drunk asleep or in his rage
or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed
at gaming swearing or about some act
that has no relish of salvation int
then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven
and that his soul may be as damn and black
as hell whereto it goes my mother stays
this physic but prolongs thy sickly days

and would it were not so you are my mother


queen gertrude

lord polonius

queen gertrude

o me what hast thou done


hamlet

nay i know not
is it the king


queen gertrude

o what a rash and bloody deed is this


hamlet

a bloody deed almost as bad good mother
as kill a king and marry with his brother


queen gertrude

as kill a king


hamlet

ay lady twas my word
lifts up the array and discovers polonius
thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell
i took thee for thy better take thy fortune
thou find to be too busy is some danger
leave wringing of your hands peace sit you down
and let me wring your heart for so i shall
if it be made of penetrable stuff
if damned custom have not brass it so
that it is proof and bulwark against sense


queen gertrude

what have i done that thou darest wag thy tongue
in noise so rude against me


hamlet

such an act
that blurs the grace and blush of modesty
calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose
from the fair forehead of an innocent love
and sets a blister there makes marriage-vows
as false as dicers oaths o such a deed
as from the body of contraction plucks
the very soul and sweet religion makes
a rhapsody of words heaven face doth glow
yea this solidity and compound mass
with tristful visage as against the doom
is thought-sick at the act


queen gertrude

ay me what act
that roars so loud and thunders in the index


hamlet

look here upon this picture and on this
the counterfeit presentment of two brothers
see what a grace was seated on this brow
hyperion curls the front of jove himself
an eye like mars to threaten and command
a station like the herald mercury
new-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill
a combination and a form indeed
where every god did seem to set his seal
to give the world assurance of a man
this was your husband look you now what follows
here is your husband like a mildew ear
blasting his wholesome brother have you eyes
could you on this fair mountain leave to feed
and batten on this moor ha have you eyes
you cannot call it love for at your age
the hey-day in the blood is tame it humble
and waits upon the judgment and what judgment
would step from this to this sense sure you have
else could you not have motion but sure that sense
is apoplex for madness would not err
nor sense to ecstasy was neer so thrall
but it reserved some quantity of choice
to serve in such a difference what devil wast
that thus hath cozen you at hoodman-blind
eyes without feeling feeling without sight
ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all
or but a sickly part of one true sense
could not so mope
o shame where is thy blush rebellious hell
if thou canst mutine in a matron bones
to flaming youth let virtue be as wax
and melt in her own fire proclaim no shame
when the compulsive ardour gives the charge
since frost itself as actively doth burn
and reason panders will


queen gertrude

o hamlet speak no more
thou turn mine eyes into my very soul
and there i see such black and grained spots
as will not leave their tinct


hamlet

nay but to live
in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed
stew in corruption honeying and making love
over the nasty sty 


queen gertrude

o speak to me no more
these words like daggers enter in mine ears
no more sweet hamlet


hamlet

a murderer and a villain
a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
of your precedent lord a vice of kings
a cutpurse of the empire and the rule
that from a shelf the precious diadem stole
and put it in his pocket


queen gertrude

no more


hamlet

a king of shreds and patches 
enter ghost
save me and hover oer me with your wings
you heavenly guards what would your gracious figure


queen gertrude

alas he mad


hamlet

do you not come your tardy son to chide
that lapsed in time and passion lets go by
the important acting of your dread command o say


ghost

do not forget this visitation
is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose
but look amazement on thy mother sits
o step between her and her fighting soul
conceit in weakest bodies strongest works
speak to her hamlet


hamlet

how is it with you lady


queen gertrude

alas how ist with you
that you do bend your eye on vacancy
and with the incorporal air do hold discourse
forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep
and as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm
your bedded hair like life in excrements
starts up and stands on end o gentle son
upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
sprinkle cool patience whereon do you look


hamlet

on him on him look you how pale he glares
his form and cause conjoin preaching to stones
would make them capable do not look upon me
lest with this piteous action you convert
my stern effects then what i have to do
will want true colour tears perchance for blood


queen gertrude

to whom do you speak this


hamlet

do you see nothing there


queen gertrude

nothing at all yet all that is i see


hamlet

nor did you nothing hear


queen gertrude

no nothing but ourselves


hamlet

why look you there look how it steals away
my father in his habit as he lived
look where he goes even now out at the portal
exit ghost


queen gertrude

this the very coinage of your brain
this bodiless creation ecstasy
is very cunning in


hamlet

ecstasy
my pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
and makes as healthful music it is not madness
that i have utter bring me to the test
and i the matter will re-word which madness
would gambol from mother for love of grace
lay not that mattering unction to your soul
that not your trespass but my madness speaks
it will but skin and film the ulcerous place
whilst rank corruption mining all within
infects unseen confess yourself to heaven
repent what past avoid what is to come
and do not spread the compost on the weeds
to make them ranker forgive me this my virtue
for in the fatness of these pursy times
virtue itself of vice must pardon beg
yea curb and woo for leave to do him good


queen gertrude

o hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain


hamlet

o throw away the worser part of it
and live the purer with the other half
good night but go not to mine uncle bed
assume a virtue if you have it not
that monster custom who all sense doth eat
of habits devil is angel yet in this
that to the use of actions fair and good
he likewise gives a frock or livery
that aptly is put on refrain to-night
and that shall lend a kind of easiness
to the next abstinence the next more easy
for use almost can change the stamp of nature
and either           the devil or throw him out
with wondrous potency once more good night
and when you are desirous to be bless
ill blessing beg of you for this same lord
pointing to polonius
i do repent but heaven hath pleased it so
to punish me with this and this with me
that i must be their scourge and minister
i will bestow him and will answer well
the death i gave him so again good night
i must be cruel only to be kind
thus bad begins and worse remains behind
one word more good lady


queen gertrude

what shall i do


hamlet

not this by no means that i bid you do
let the bloat king tempt you again to bed
pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse
and let him for a pair of reechy kisses
or paddling in your neck with his damn fingers
make you to ravel all this matter out
that i essentially am not in madness
but mad in craft twere good you let him know
for who that but a queen fair sober wise
would from a paddock from a bat a gib
such dear concernings hide who would do so
no in despite of sense and secrecy
unpeg the basket on the house top
let the birds fly and like the famous ape
to try conclusions in the basket creep
and break your own neck down


queen gertrude

be thou assured if words be made of breath
and breath of life i have no life to breathe
what thou hast said to me


hamlet

i must to england you know that


queen gertrude

alack
i had forgot tis so concluded on


hamlet

there letters seal and my two schoolfellows
whom i will trust as i will adders fang
they bear the mandate they must sweep my way
and marshal me to knavery let it work
for tis the sport to have the engineer
hoist with his own petard and t shall go hard
but i will delve one yard below their mines
and blow them at the moon o tis most sweet
when in one line two crafts directly meet
this man shall set me packing
ill lug the guts into the neighbour room
mother good night indeed this counsellor
is now most still most secret and most grave
who was in life a foolish prating knave
come sir to draw toward an end with you
good night mother

exeunt all except hamlet
how all occasions do inform against me
and spur my dull revenge what is a man
if his chief good and market of his time
be but to sleep and feed a beast no more
sure he that made us with such large discourse
looking before and after gave us not
that capability and god-like reason
to fust in us unused now whether it be
bestial oblivion or some craven scruple
of thinking too precisely on the event
a thought which quarter hath but one part wisdom
and ever three parts coward i do not know
why yet i live to say this thing to do
sith i have cause and will and strength and means
to dot examples gross as earth exhort me
witness this army of such mass and charge
led by a delicate and tender prince
whose spirit with divine ambition puff
makes mouths at the invisible event
exposing what is mortal and unsure
to all that fortune death and danger dare
even for an egg-shell rightly to be great
is not to stir without great argument
but greatly to find quarrel in a straw
when honour at the stake how stand i then
that have a father kill a mother stain
excitements of my reason and my blood
and let all sleep while to my shame i see
the imminent death of twenty thousand men
that for a fantasy and trick of fame
go to their graves like beds fight for a plot
whereon the numbers cannot try the cause
which is not tomb enough and continent
to hide the slain o from this time forth
my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth

gentleman

she speaks much of her father says she hears
there tricks i the world and hems and beats her heart
spurns enviously at straws speaks things in doubt
that carry but half sense her speech is nothing
yet the unshaped use of it doth move
the hearers to collection they aim at it
and botch the words up fit to their own thoughts
which as her winks and nods and gestures
yield them
indeed would make one think there might be thought
though nothing sure yet much unhappily


horatio

twere good she were spoken with for she may strew
dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds


queen gertrude

o this is the poison of deep grief it springs
all from her father death o gertrude gertrude
when sorrows come they come not single spies
but in battalions first her father slain
next your son gone and he most violent author
of his own just remove the people muddied
thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
for good polonius death and we have done but greenly
in hugger-mugger to inter him poor ophelia
divided from herself and her fair judgment
without the which we are pictures or mere beasts
last and as much containing as all these
her brother is in secret come from france
feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds
and wants not buzzers to infect his ear
with pestilent speeches of his father death
wherein necessity of matter beggar
will nothing stick our person to arraign
in ear and ear o my dear gertrude this
like to a murdering-piece in many places
gives me superfluous death
a noise within


queen gertrude

alack what noise is this


king claudius

where are my switzers let them guard the door
enter another gentleman
what is the matter


gentleman

save yourself my lord
the ocean overpeering of his list
eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
than young laertes in a riotous head
oerbears your officers the rabble call him lord
and as the world were now but to begin
antiquity forgot custom not known
the ratifiers and props of every word
they cry choose we laertes shall be king
caps hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds
laertes shall be king laertes king


queen gertrude

how cheerfully on the false trail they cry
o this is counter you false danish dogs

laertes

i thank you keep the door o thou vile king
give me my father


queen gertrude

calmly good laertes


laertes

that drop of blood that calm proclaims me bastard
cries cuckold to my father brands the harlot
even here between the chaste unsmirched brow
of my true mother


king claudius

what is the cause laertes
that thy rebellion looks so giant-like
let him go gertrude do not fear our person
there such divinity doth hedge a king
that treason can but peep to what it would
acts little of his will tell me laertes
why thou art thus incensed let him go gertrude
speak man


laertes

where is my father


king claudius

dead


queen gertrude

but not by him


king claudius

let him demand his fill


laertes

how came he dead ill not be juggled with
to hell allegiance vows to the blackest devil
conscience and grace to the profoundest pit
i dare damnation to this point i stand
that both the worlds i give to negligence
let come what comes only ill be revenged
most thoroughly for my father


king claudius

who shall stay you


laertes

my will not all the world
and for my means ill husband them so well
they shall go far with little


king claudius

good laertes
if you desire to know the certainty
of your dear father death ist writ in your revenge
that swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe
winner and loser


laertes

none but his enemies


king claudius

will you know them then


laertes

to his good friends thus wide ill ope my arms
and like the kind life-rendering pelican
repast them with my blood


king claudius

why now you speak
like a good child and a true gentleman
that i am guiltless of your father death
and am most sensible in grief for it
it shall as level to your judgment pierce
as day does to your eye


danes

within                let her come in


laertes

how now what noise is that
re-enter ophelia
o heat dry up my brains tears seven times salt
burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye
by heaven thy madness shall be paid by weight
till our scale turn the beam o rose of may
dear maid kind sister sweet ophelia
o heavens ist possible a young maid wits
should be as moral as an old man life
nature is fine in love and where tis fine
it sends some precious instance of itself
after the thing it loves


ophelia

sings
they bore him barefaced on the bier
hey non nonny nonny hey nonny
and in his grave rain many a tear 
fare you well my dove


laertes

hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge
it could not move thus


ophelia

sings
you must sing a-down a-down
an you call him a-down-a
o how the wheel becomes it it is the false
steward that stole his master daughter


laertes

this nothing more than matter


ophelia

there rosemary that for remembrance pray
love remember and there is pansies that for thoughts


laertes

a document in madness thoughts and remembrance fitted


ophelia

there fennel for you and columbines there rue
for you and here some for me we may call it
herb-grace o sundays o you must wear your rue with
a difference there a daisy i would give you
some violets but they withered all when my father
died they say he made a good end 
sings
for bonny sweet robin is all my joy


laertes

thought and affliction passion hell itself
she turns to favour and to prettiness


ophelia

sings
and will he not come again
and will he not come again
no no he is dead
go to thy death-bed
he never will come again
his beard was as white as snow
all flaxen was his poll
he is gone he is gone
and we cast away moan
god ha mercy on his soul
and of all christian souls i pray god god be wi ye

laertes

do you see this o god


king claudius

laertes i must commune with your grief
or you deny me right go but apart
make choice of whom your wisest friends you will

if by direct or by collateral hand
they find us touch we will our kingdom give
our crown our life and all that we can ours
to you in satisfaction but if not
be you content to lend your patience to us
and we shall jointly labour with your soul
to give it due content

no trophy sword nor hatchment oer his bones

scene vii another room in the castle

enter king claudius and laertes


king claudius

now must your conscience my acquaintance seal
and you must put me in your heart for friend
sith you have heard and with a knowing ear
that he which hath your noble father slain
pursued my life


laertes

it well appears but tell me
why you proceeded not against these feats
so crimeful and so capital in nature
as by your safety wisdom all things else
you mainly were stirr up


king claudius

o for two special reasons
which may to you perhaps seem much unsinew
but yet to me they are strong the queen his mother
lives almost by his looks and for myself 
my virtue or my plague be it either which 
she so conjunctive to my life and soul
that as the star moves not but in his sphere
i could not but by her the other motive
why to a public count i might not go
is the great love the general gender bear him
who dipping all his faults in their affection
would like the spring that turneth wood to stone
convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows
too slightly timber for so loud a wind
would have reverted to my bow again
and not where i had aim them


laertes

and so have i a noble father lost
a sister driven into desperate terms
whose worth if praises may go back again
stood challenger on mount of all the age
for her perfections but my revenge will come


king claudius

break not your sleeps for that you must not think
that we are made of stuff so flat and dull
that we can let our beard be shook with danger
and think it pastime you shortly shall hear more
i loved your father and we love ourself
and that i hope will teach you to imagine 
enter a messenger

your kingdom to-morrow shall i beg leave to see
your kingly eyes when i shall first asking your
pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden
and more strange return                  hamlet
what should this mean are all the rest come back
or is it some abuse and no such thing


laertes

know you the hand


king claudius

tis hamlets character naked
and in a postscript here he says alone
can you advise me


laertes

im lost in it my lord but let him come
it warms the very sickness in my heart
that i shall live and tell him to his teeth
thus didest thou


king claudius

if it be so laertes 
as how should it be so how otherwise 
will you be ruled by me


laertes

ay my lord
so you will not oerrule me to a peace


king claudius

to thine own peace if he be now return
as checking at his voyage and that he means
no more to undertake it i will work him
to an exploit now ripe in my device
under the which he shall not choose but fall
and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe
but even his mother shall uncharge the practise
and call it accident


laertes

my lord i will be ruled
the rather if you could devise it so
that i might be the organ


king claudius

it falls right
you have been talk of since your travel much
and that in hamlet hearing for a quality
wherein they say you shine your sum of parts
did not together pluck such envy from him
as did that one and that in my regard
of the unworthiest siege


laertes

what part is that my lord


king claudius

a very riband in the cap of youth
yet needful too for youth no less becomes
the light and careless livery that it wears
than settled age his sables and his weeds
importing health and graveness two months since
here was a gentleman of normandy 
ive seen myself and served against the french
and they can well on horseback but this gallant
had witchcraft int he grew unto his seat
and to such wondrous doing brought his horse
as he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
with the brave beast so far he topp my thought
that i in forgery of shapes and tricks
come short of what he did


laertes

a norman wast


king claudius

a norman


laertes

upon my life lamond


king claudius

the very same


laertes

i know him well he is the brooch indeed
and gem of all the nation


king claudius

he made confession of you
and gave you such a masterly report
for art and exercise in your defence
and for your rapier most especially
that he cried out twould be a sight indeed
if one could match you the scrimers of their nation
he swore had had neither motion guard nor eye
if you opposed them sir this report of his
did hamlet so envenom with his envy
that he could nothing do but wish and beg
your sudden coming oer to play with him
now out of this 


laertes

what out of this my lord


king claudius

laertes was your father dear to you
or are you like the painting of a sorrow
a face without a heart


laertes

why ask you this


king claudius

not that i think you did not love your father
but that i know love is begun by time
and that i see in passages of proof
time qualifies the spark and fire of it
there lives within the very flame of love
a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it
and nothing is at a like goodness still
for goodness growing to a plurisy
dies in his own too much that we would do
we should do when we would for this would changes
and hath abatements and delays as many
as there are tongues are hands are accidents
and then this hould is like a spendthrift sigh
that hurts by easing but to the quick o the ulcer 
hamlet comes back what would you undertake
to show yourself your father son in deed
more than in words


laertes

to cut his throat i the church


king claudius

no place indeed should murder sanctuarize
revenge should have no bounds but good laertes
will you do this keep close within your chamber
hamlet return shall know you are come home
well put on those shall praise your excellence
and set a double varnish on the fame
the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together
and wager on your heads he being remiss
most generous and free from all contriving
will not peruse the foils so that with ease
or with a little shuffling you may choose
a sword unbated and in a pass of practise
requite him for your father


laertes

i will dot
and for that purpose ill anoint my sword
i bought an unction of a mountebank
so mortal that but dip a knife in it
where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare
collected from all simples that have virtue
under the moon can save the thing from death
that is but scratch withal ill touch my point
with this contagion that if i gall him slightly
it may be death


king claudius

let further think of this
weigh what convenience both of time and means
may fit us to our shape if this should fail
and that our drift look through our bad performance
twere better not assay therefore this project
should have a back or second that might hold
if this should blast in proof soft let me see
well make a solemn wager on your cunnings i hat
when in your motion you are hot and dry 
as make your bouts more violent to that end 
and that he calls for drink ill have prepared him
a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping
if he by chance escape your venom stuck
our purpose may hold there
enter queen gertrude
how now sweet queen


queen gertrude

one woe doth tread upon another heel
so fast they follow your sister drown laertes


laertes

drown o where


queen gertrude

there is a willow grows aslant a brook
that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream
there with fantastic garlands did she come
of crow-flowers nettles daisies and long purples
that liberal shepherds give a grosser name
but our cold maids do dead men fingers call them
there on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
clambering to hang an envious sliver broke
when down her weedy trophies and herself
fell in the weeping brook her clothes spread wide
and mermaid-like awhile they bore her up
which time she chanted snatches of old tunes
as one incapable of her own distress
or like a creature native and indued
unto that element but long it could not be
till that her garments heavy with their drink
pull the poor wretch from her melodious lay
to muddy death


laertes

alas then she is drown


queen gertrude

drown drown


laertes

too much of water hast thou poor ophelia
and therefore i forbid my tears but yet
it is our trick nature her custom holds
let shame say what it will when these are gone
the woman will be out adieu my lord
i have a speech of fire that fain would blaze
but that this folly douts it
exit


king claudius

how much i had to do to calm his rage
now fear i this will give it start again

hath claw me in his clutch
and hath shipped me intil the land

lawyer where be his quiddities now his quillets

suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of
his action of battery hum this fellow might be
in time a great buyer of land with his statutes
his recognizances his fines his double vouchers
his recoveries is this the fine of his fines and
the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine
pate full of fine dirt will his vouchers vouch him
no more of his purchases and double ones too than
the length and breadth of a pair of indentures the
very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
this box and must the inheritor himself have no more ha


horatio

peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
gaffs his kibe how long hast thou been a
grave-maker

have many pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce
hold the laying in he will last you some eight year
or nine year a tanner will last you nine year


hamlet

first clown

he will keep out water a great while and your water
is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body

not how oft where be your gibes now your
gambols your songs your flashes of merriment
that were wont to set the table on a roar not one

hamlet

and smelt so pah
puts down the skull


horatio

een so my lord


hamlet

to what base uses we may return horatio why may
not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander
till he find it stopping a bung-hole


horatio

twere to consider too curiously to consider so


hamlet

no faith not a jot but to follow him thither with
modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as
thus alexander died alexander was buried
alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of
earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he
was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel
imperious caesar dead and turn to clay
might stop a hole to keep the wind away
o that that earth which kept the world in awe
should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw
but soft but soft aside here comes the king
enter priest   c in procession the corpse of  ophelia laertes and mourners following king claudius queen gertrude their trains   c
the queen the courtiers who is this they follow
and with such maimed rites this doth betoken
the corse they follow did with desperate hand
fordo its own life twas of some estate
couch we awhile and mark
retiring with horatio


laertes

hamlet

that is laertes
a very noble youth mark


laertes

what ceremony else


first priest

her obsequies have been as far enlarged
as we have warrantise her death was doubtful
and but that great command oersways the order
she should in ground unsanctified have lodged
till the last trumpet for charitable prayers
shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her
yet here she is allow her virgin crants
her maiden strewments and the bringing home
of bell and burial


laertes

must there no more be done


first priest

no more be done
we should profane the service of the dead
to sing a requiem and such rest to her
as to peace-parted souls


laertes

lay her i the earth
and from her fair and unpolluted flesh
may violets spring i tell thee churlish priest
a ministering angel shall my sister be
when thou liest howling


hamlet

what the fair ophelia


queen gertrude

sweets to the sweet farewell
scattering flowers
i hoped thou shouldst have been my hamlet wife
i thought thy bride-bed to have deck sweet maid
and not have strew thy grave


laertes

o treble woe
fall ten times treble on that cursed head
whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
deprived thee of hold off the earth awhile
till i have caught her once more in mine arms
leaps into the grave
now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
till of this flat a mountain you have made
to oertop old pelion or the skyish head
of blue olympus


hamlet

advancing     what is he whose grief
bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow
conjures the wandering stars and makes them stand
like wonder-wounded hearers this is i
hamlet the dane
leaps into the grave


laertes

the devil take thy soul
grappling with him


hamlet

thou pray not well
i prithee take thy fingers from my throat
for though i am not splenitive and rash
yet have i something in me dangerous
which let thy wiseness fear hold off thy hand


king claudius

pluck them asunder


queen gertrude

hamlet hamlet


all

gentlemen 


horatio

the attendants part them and they come out of the grave


hamlet

why i will fight with him upon this theme
until my eyelids will no longer wag


queen gertrude

hamlet

i loved ophelia forty thousand brothers
could not with all their quantity of love
make up my sum what wilt thou do for her


king claudius

o he is mad laertes


queen gertrude

for love of god forbear him


hamlet

wounds show me what thoult do
woot weep woot fight woot fast woot tear thyself
woot drink up eisel eat a crocodile
ill dot dost thou come here to whine
to outface me with leaping in her grave
be buried quick with her and so will i
and if thou prate of mountains let them throw
millions of acres on us till our ground
singeing his pate against the burning zone
make ossa like a wart nay an thoult mouth
ill rant as well as thou


queen gertrude

this is mere madness
and thus awhile the fit will work on him
anon as patient as the female dove
when that her golden couplets are disclosed
his silence will sit drooping


hamlet

hear you sir
what is the reason that you use me thus
i loved you ever but it is no matter
let hercules himself do what he may
the cat will mew and dog will have his day
exit


king claudius

i pray you good horatio wait upon him
exit horatio

exeunt

scene ii a hall in the castle

enter hamlet and horatio


hamlet

so much for this sir now shall you see the other
you do remember all the circumstance


horatio

remember it my lord


hamlet

sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting
that would not let me sleep methought i lay
worse than the mutines in the bilboes rashly
and praised be rashness for it let us know
our indiscretion sometimes serves us well
when our deep plots do pall and that should teach us
there a divinity that shapes our ends
rough-hew them how we will 


horatio

that is most certain


hamlet

up from my cabin
my sea-gown scarf about me in the dark
groped i to find out them had my desire
finger their packet and in fine withdrew
to mine own room again making so bold
my fears forgetting manners to unseal
their grand commission where i found horatio 
o royal knavery an exact command
larded with many several sorts of reasons
importing denmark health and england too
with ho such bugs and goblins in my life
that on the supervise no leisure bated
no not to stay the grinding of the axe
my head should be struck off


horatio

ist possible


hamlet

here the commission read it at more leisure
but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed


horatio

i beseech you


hamlet

being thus be-netted round with villanies 
ere i could make a prologue to my brains
they had begun the play i sat me down
devised a new commission wrote it fair
i once did hold it as our statists do
a baseness to write fair and labour much
how to forget that learning but sir now
it did me yeoman service wilt thou know
the effect of what i wrote


horatio

ay good my lord


hamlet

an earnest conjuration from the king
as england was his faithful tributary
as love between them like the palm might flourish
as peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
and stand a comma tween their amities
and many such-like ases of great charge
that on the view and knowing of these contents
without debatement further more or less
he should the bearers put to sudden death
not shriving-time allow


horatio

how was this seal


hamlet

why even in that was heaven ordinant
i had my father signet in my purse
which was the model of that danish seal
folded the writ up in form of the other
subscribed it gavet the impression placed it safely
the changeling never known now the next day
was our sea-fight and what to this was sequent
thou know already


horatio

so guildenstern and rosencrantz go tot


hamlet

why man they did make love to this employment
they are not near my conscience their defeat
does by their own insinuation grow
tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
between the pass and fell incensed points
of mighty opposites


horatio

why what a king is this


hamlet

does it not think thee stand me now upon 
he that hath kill my king and whored my mother
popp in between the election and my hopes
thrown out his angle for my proper life
and with such cozenage ist not perfect conscience
to quit him with this arm and ist not to be damn
to let this canker of our nature come
in further evil


horatio

it must be shortly known to him from england
what is the issue of the business there


hamlet

it will be short the interim is mine
and a man life no more than to say one
but i am very sorry good horatio
that to laertes i forgot myself
for by the image of my cause i see
the portraiture of his ill court his favours
but sure the bravery of his grief did put me
into a towering passion


horatio

peace who comes here
enter osric


osric

your lordship is right welcome back to denmark


hamlet

i humbly thank you sir dost know this water-fly


horatio

no my good lord


hamlet

thy state is the more gracious for tis a vice to
know him he hath much land and fertile let a
beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at
the king mess tis a chough but as i say
spacious in the possession of dirt


osric

sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure i
should impart a thing to you from his majesty


hamlet

i will receive it sir with all diligence of
spirit put your bonnet to his right use tis for the head


osric

i thank your lordship it is very hot


hamlet

no believe me tis very cold the wind is
northerly


osric

it is indifferent cold my lord indeed


hamlet

but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion


osric

exceedingly my lord it is very sultry as
twere i cannot tell how but my lord his
majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
great wager on your head sir this is the matter 


hamlet

i beseech you remember 
hamlet moves him to put on his hat


osric

nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith
sir here is newly come to court laertes believe
me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent
differences of very soft society and great showing
indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or
calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the
continent of what part a gentleman would see


hamlet

sir his definement suffers no perdition in you
though i know to divide him inventorially would
dizzy the arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw
neither in respect of his quick sail but in the
verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of
great article and his infusion of such dearth and
rareness as to make true diction of him his
semblable is his mirror and who else would trace
him his umbrage nothing more


osric

your lordship speaks most infallibly of him


hamlet

the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman
in our more rawer breath


osric

sir


horatio

ist not possible to understand in another tongue
you will dot sir really


hamlet

what imports the nomination of this gentleman


osric

of laertes


horatio

his purse is empty already all golden words are spent


hamlet

of him sir


osric

i know you are not ignorant 


hamlet

i would you did sir yet in faith if you did
it would not much approve me well sir


osric

you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is 


hamlet

i dare not confess that lest i should compare with
him in excellence but to know a man well were to
know himself


osric

i mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation
laid on him by them in his meed he unfellowed


hamlet

what his weapon


osric

rapier and dagger


hamlet

that two of his weapons but well


osric

the king sir hath wagered with him six barbary
horses against the which he has imponed as i take
it six french rapiers and poniards with their
assigns as girdle hangers and so three of the
carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very
responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages
and of very liberal conceit


hamlet

what call you the carriages


horatio

i knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done


osric

the carriages sir are the hangers


hamlet

the phrase would be more german to the matter if we
could carry cannon by our sides i would it might
be hangers till then but on six barbary horses
against six french swords their assigns and three
liberal-conceited carriages that the french bet
against the danish why is this imponed as you call it


osric

the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes
between yourself and him he shall not exceed you
three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine and it
would come to immediate trial if your lordship
would vouchsafe the answer


hamlet

how if i answer no


osric

i mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial


hamlet

sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his
majesty tis the breathing time of day with me let
the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the
king hold his purpose i will win for him an i can
if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits


osric

shall i re-deliver you een so


hamlet

to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will


osric

i commend my duty to your lordship


hamlet

yours yours
exit osric
he does well to commend it himself there are no
tongues else for turn


horatio

this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head


hamlet

he did comply with his dug before he sucked it
thus has he and many more of the same bevy that i
know the dressy age dotes on only got the tune of
the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of
yesty collection which carries them through and
through the most fond and winnowed opinions and do
but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out
enter a lord


lord

my lord his majesty commended him to you by young
osric who brings back to him that you attend him in
the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
play with laertes or that you will take longer time


hamlet

i am constant to my purpose they follow the king
pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now
or whensoever provided i be so able as now


lord

the king and queen and all are coming down


hamlet

in happy time


lord

the queen desires you to use some gentle
entertainment to laertes before you fall to play


hamlet

she well instructs me
exit lord


horatio

you will lose this wager my lord


hamlet

i do not think so since he went into france i
have been in continual practise i shall win at the
odds but thou wouldst not think how ill all here
about my heart but it is no matter


horatio

nay good my lord 


hamlet

it is but foolery but it is such a kind of
gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman


horatio

if your mind dislike any thing obey it i will
forestall their repair hither and say you are not
fit


hamlet

not a whit we defy augury there a special
providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now
tis not to come if it be not to come it will be
now if it be not now yet it will come the
readiness is all since no man has aught of what he
leaves what ist to leave betimes
enter king claudius queen gertrude laertes lords osric and attendants with foils   c


king claudius

come hamlet come and take this hand from me
king claudius puts laertes hand into hamlet


hamlet

give me your pardon sir ive done you wrong
but pardont as you are a gentleman
this presence knows
and you must needs have heard how i am punish
with sore distraction what i have done
that might your nature honour and exception
roughly awake i here proclaim was madness
wast hamlet wrong laertes never hamlet
if hamlet from himself be taen away
and when he not himself does wrong laertes
then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it
who does it then his madness ift be so
hamlet is of the faction that is wrong
his madness is poor hamlet enemy
sir in this audience
let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
free me so far in your most generous thoughts
that i have shot mine arrow oer the house
and hurt my brother


laertes

i am satisfied in nature
whose motive in this case should stir me most
to my revenge but in my terms of honour
i stand aloof and will no reconcilement
till by some elder masters of known honour
i have a voice and precedent of peace
to keep my name ungored but till that time
i do receive your offer love like love
and will not wrong it


hamlet

i embrace it freely
and will this brother wager frankly play
give us the foils come on


laertes

o good horatio what a wounded name
things standing thus unknown shall live behind me
if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
absent thee from felicity awhile
and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain
to tell my story
march afar off and shot within
what warlike noise is this


osric

young fortinbras with conquest come from poland
to the ambassadors of england gives
this warlike volley


hamlet

o i die horatio
the potent poison quite oer-crows my spirit
i cannot live to hear the news from england
but i do prophesy the election lights
on fortinbras he has my dying voice
so tell him with the occurrents more and less
which have solicited the rest is silence
dies


horatio

now cracks a noble heart good night sweet prince
and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
why does the drum come hither
march within
enter fortinbras the english ambassadors and others


prince fortinbras

where is this sight


horatio

what is it ye would see
if aught of woe or wonder cease your search


prince fortinbras

this quarry cries on havoc o proud death
what feast is toward in thine eternal cell
that thou so many princes at a shot
so bloodily hast struck


first ambassador

the sight is dismal
and our affairs from england come too late
the ears are senseless that should give us hearing
to tell him his commandment is fulfill
that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead
where should we have our thanks


horatio

not from his mouth
had it the ability of life to thank you
he never gave commandment for their death
but since so jump upon this bloody question
you from the polack wars and you from england
are here arrived give order that these bodies
high on a stage be placed to the view
and let me speak to the yet unknowing world
how these things came about so shall you hear
of carnal bloody and unnatural acts
of accidental judgments casual slaughters
of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause
and in this upshot purposes mistook
falln on the inventors reads all this can i
truly deliver


prince fortinbras

let us haste to hear it
and call the noblest to the audience
for me with sorrow i embrace my fortune
i have some rights of memory in this kingdom
which now to claim my vantage doth invite me


horatio

of that i shall have also cause to speak
and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more
but let this same be presently perform
even while men minds are wild lest more mischance
on plots and errors happen


prince fortinbras

let four captains
bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage
for he was likely had he been put on
to have proved most royally and for his passage
the soldiers music and the rites of war
speak loudly for him
take up the bodies such a sight as this
becomes the field but here shows much amiss
go bid the soldiers shoot
a dead march exeunt bearing off the dead bodies after which a peal of ordnance is shot off

o for a muse of fire that would ascend
the brightest heaven of invention
a kingdom for a stage princes to act
and monarchs to behold the swelling scene
then should the warlike harry like himself
assume the port of mars and at his heels
leash in like hounds should famine sword and fire
crouch for employment but pardon and gentles all

on this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
so great an object can this cockpit hold
the vasty fields of france or may we cram
within this wooden o the very casques
that did affright the air at agincourt
o pardon since a crooked figure may
attest in little place a million
and let us ciphers to this great accompt
on your imaginary forces work
suppose within the girdle of these walls
are now confined two mighty monarchies
whose high upreared and abutting fronts
the perilous narrow ocean parts asunder
piece out our imperfections with your thoughts
into a thousand parts divide on man
and make imaginary puissance
think when we talk of horses that you see them
printing their proud hoofs i the receiving earth

carry them here and there jumping oer times
turning the accomplishment of many years
into an hour-glass for the which supply

scene i london an ante-chamber in the king palace

enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely


canterbury

my lord ill tell you that self bill is urged
which in the eleventh year of the last king reign
was like and had indeed against us pass
but that the scambling and unquiet time
did push it out of farther question


ely

but how my lord shall we resist it now


canterbury

it must be thought on if it pass against us
we lose the better half of our possession
for all the temporal lands which men devout
by testament have given to the church
would they strip from us being valued thus
as much as would maintain to the king honour
full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights
six thousand and two hundred good esquires
and to relief of lazars and weak age
of indigent faint souls past corporal toil
a hundred almshouses right well supplied
and to the coffers of the king beside
a thousand pounds by the year thus runs the bill


ely

this would drink deep


canterbury

twould drink the cup and all


ely

but what prevention


canterbury

the king is full of grace and fair regard


ely

and a true lover of the holy church


canterbury

the courses of his youth promised it not
the breath no sooner left his father body
but that his wildness mortified in him
seem to die too yea at that very moment
consideration like an angel came
and whipp the offending adam out of him
leaving his body as a paradise
to envelop and contain celestial spirits
never was such a sudden scholar made
never came reformation in a flood
with such a heady currance scouring faults
nor never hydra-headed wilfulness
so soon did lose his seat and all at once
as in this king


ely

we are blessed in the change


canterbury

hear him but reason in divinity
and all-admiring with an inward wish
you would desire the king were made a prelate
hear him debate of commonwealth affairs
you would say it hath been all in all his study
list his discourse of war and you shall hear
a fearful battle render you in music
turn him to any cause of policy
the gordian knot of it he will unloose
familiar as his garter that when he speaks
the air a charter libertine is still
and the mute wonder lurketh in men ears
to steal his sweet and honey sentences
so that the art and practic part of life
must be the mistress to this theoric
which is a wonder how his grace should glean it
since his addiction was to courses vain
his companies unletter rude and shallow
his hours fill up with riots banquets sports
and never noted in him any study
any retirement any sequestration
from open haunts and popularity


ely

the strawberry grows underneath the nettle
and wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
neighbour by fruit of baser quality
and so the prince obscured his contemplation
under the veil of wildness which no doubt
grew like the summer grass fastest by night
unseen yet crescive in his faculty


canterbury

it must be so for miracles are ceased
and therefore we must needs admit the means
how things are perfected


ely

but my good lord
how now for mitigation of this bill
urged by the commons doth his majesty
incline to it or no


canterbury

he seems indifferent
or rather swaying more upon our part
than cherishing the exhibiters against us
for i have made an offer to his majesty
upon our spiritual convocation
and in regard of causes now in hand
which i have open to his grace at large
as touching france to give a greater sum
than ever at one time the clergy yet
did to his predecessors part withal


ely

how did this offer seem received my lord


canterbury

with good acceptance of his majesty
save that there was not time enough to hear
as i perceived his grace would fain have done
the severals and unhidden passages
of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
and generally to the crown and seat of france
derived from edward his great-grandfather


ely

what was the impediment that broke this off


canterbury

the french ambassador upon that instant
craved audience and the hour i think is come
to give him hearing is it four oclock


ely

it is


canterbury

then go we in to know his embassy
which i could with a ready guess declare
before the frenchman speak a word of it


ely

ill wait upon you and i long to hear it

scene ii the same the presence chamber

enter king henry v gloucester bedford exeter warwick westmoreland and attendants


king henry v

where is my gracious lord of canterbury


exeter

not here in presence


king henry v

send for him good uncle


westmoreland

shall we call in the ambassador my liege


king henry v

not yet my cousin we would be resolved
before we hear him of some things of weight
that task our thoughts concerning us and france
enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely


canterbury

god and his angels guard your sacred throne
and make you long become it


king henry v

sure we thank you
my learned lord we pray you to proceed
and justly and religiously unfold
why the law salique that they have in france
or should or should not bar us in our claim
and god forbid my dear and faithful lord
that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading
or nicely charge your understanding soul
with opening titles miscreate whose right
suits not in native colours with the truth
for god doth know how many now in health
shall drop their blood in approbation
of what your reverence shall incite us to
therefore take heed how you impawn our person
how you awake our sleeping sword of war
we charge you in the name of god take heed
for never two such kingdoms did contend
without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops
are every one a woe a sore complaint
gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
that make such waste in brief mortality
under this conjuration speak my lord
for we will hear note and believe in heart
that what you speak is in your conscience wash
as pure as sin with baptism


canterbury

then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers
that owe yourselves your lives and services
to this imperial throne there is no bar
to make against your highness claim to france
but this which they produce from pharamond
in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant
no woman shall succeed in salique land
which salique land the french unjustly gloze
to be the realm of france and pharamond
the founder of this law and female bar
yet their own authors faithfully affirm
that the land salique is in germany
between the floods of sala and of elbe
where charles the great having subdued the saxons
there left behind and settled certain french
who holding in disdain the german women
for some dishonest manners of their life
establish then this law to wit no female
should be inheritrix in salique land
which salique as i said twixt elbe and sala
is at this day in germany call meisen
then doth it well appear that salique law
was not devised for the realm of france
nor did the french possess the salique land
until four hundred one and twenty years
after defunction of king pharamond
idly supposed the founder of this law
who died within the year of our redemption
four hundred twenty-six and charles the great
subdued the saxons and did seat the french
beyond the river sala in the year
eight hundred five besides their writers say
king pepin which deposed childeric
did as heir general being descended
of blithild which was daughter to king clothair
make claim and title to the crown of france
hugh capet also who usurped the crown
of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male
of the true line and stock of charles the great
to find his title with some shows of truth
through in pure truth it was corrupt and naught
convey himself as heir to the lady lingare
daughter to charlemain who was the son
to lewis the emperor and lewis the son
of charles the great also king lewis the tenth
who was sole heir to the usurper capet
could not keep quiet in his conscience
wearing the crown of france till satisfied
that fair queen isabel his grandmother
was lineal of the lady ermengare
daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine
by the which marriage the line of charles the great
was re-united to the crown of france
so that as clear as is the summer sun
king pepin title and hugh capet claim
king lewis his satisfaction all appear
to hold in right and title of the female
so do the kings of france unto this day
howbeit they would hold up this salique law
to bar your highness claiming from the female
and rather choose to hide them in a net
than amply to imbar their crooked titles
usurp from you and your progenitors


king henry v

may i with right and conscience make this claim


canterbury

the sin upon my head dread sovereign
for in the book of numbers is it writ
when the man dies let the inheritance
descend unto the daughter gracious lord
stand for your own unwind your bloody flag
look back into your mighty ancestors
go my dread lord to your great-grandsire tomb
from whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit
and your great-uncle edward the black prince
who on the french ground play a tragedy
making defeat on the full power of france
whiles his most mighty father on a hill
stood smiling to behold his lion whelp
forage in blood of french nobility
o noble english that could entertain
with half their forces the full pride of france
and let another half stand laughing by
all out of work and cold for action


ely

awake remembrance of these valiant dead
and with your puissant arm renew their feats
you are their heir you sit upon their throne
the blood and courage that renowned them
runs in your veins and my thrice-puissant liege
is in the very may-morn of his youth
ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises


exeter

your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
do all expect that you should rouse yourself
as did the former lions of your blood


westmoreland

they know your grace hath cause and means and might
so hath your highness never king of england
had nobles richer and more loyal subjects
whose hearts have left their bodies here in england
and lie pavilion in the fields of france


canterbury

o let their bodies follow my dear liege
with blood and sword and fire to win your right
in aid whereof we of the spiritualty
will raise your highness such a mighty sum
as never did the clergy at one time
bring in to any of your ancestors


king henry v

we must not only arm to invade the french
but lay down our proportions to defend
against the scot who will make road upon us
with all advantages


canterbury

they of those marches gracious sovereign
shall be a wall sufficient to defend
our inland from the pilfering borderers


king henry v

we do not mean the coursing snatchers only
but fear the main intendment of the scot
who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us
for you shall read that my great-grandfather
never went with his forces into france
but that the scot on his unfurnish kingdom
came pouring like the tide into a breach
with ample and brim fulness of his force
galling the gleaned land with hot assays
girding with grievous siege castles and towns
that england being empty of defence
hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood


canterbury

she hath been then more fear than harm my liege
for hear her but exampled by herself
when all her chivalry hath been in france
and she a mourning widow of her nobles
she hath herself not only well defended
but taken and impounded as a stray
the king of scots whom she did send to france
to fill king edward fame with prisoner kings
and make her chronicle as rich with praise
as is the ooze and bottom of the sea
with sunken wreck and sunless treasuries


westmoreland

but there a saying very old and true
if that you will france win
then with scotland first begin
for once the eagle england being in prey
to her unguarded nest the weasel scot
comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs
playing the mouse in absence of the cat
to tear and havoc more than she can eat


exeter

it follows then the cat must stay at home
yet that is but a crush necessity
since we have locks to safeguard necessaries
and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves
while that the armed hand doth fight abroad
the advised head defends itself at home
for government though high and low and lower
put into parts doth keep in one consent
congreeing in a full and natural close
like music


canterbury

therefore doth heaven divide
the state of man in divers functions
setting endeavour in continual motion
to which is fixed as an aim or butt
obedience for so work the honey-bees
creatures that by a rule in nature teach
the act of order to a peopled kingdom
they have a king and officers of sorts
where some like magistrates correct at home
others like merchants venture trade abroad
others like soldiers armed in their stings
make boot upon the summer velvet buds
which pillage they with merry march bring home
to the tent-royal of their emperor
who busied in his majesty surveys
the singing masons building roofs of gold
the civil citizens kneading up the honey
the poor mechanic porters crowding in
their heavy burdens at his narrow gate
the sad-eyed justice with his surly hum
delivering oer to executors pale
the lazy yawning drone i this infer
that many things having full reference
to one consent may work contrariously
as many arrows loosed several ways
come to one mark as many ways meet in one town
as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea
as many lines close in the dial centre
so may a thousand actions once afoot
end in one purpose and be all well borne
without defeat therefore to france my liege
divide your happy england into four
whereof take you one quarter into france
and you withal shall make all gallia shake
if we with thrice such powers left at home
cannot defend our own doors from the dog
let us be worried and our nation lose
the name of hardiness and policy


king henry v

call in the messengers sent from the dauphin
exeunt some attendants
now are we well resolved and by god help
and yours the noble sinews of our power
france being ours well bend it to our awe
or break it all to pieces or there well sit
ruling in large and ample empery
oer france and all her almost kingly dukedoms
or lay these bones in an unworthy urn
tombless with no remembrance over them
either our history shall with full mouth
speak freely of our acts or else our grave
like turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth
not worshipp with a waxen epitaph
enter ambassadors of france
now are we well prepared to know the pleasure
of our fair cousin dauphin for we hear
your greeting is from him not from the king


first ambassador

mayt please your majesty to give us leave
freely to render what we have in charge
or shall we sparingly show you far off
the dauphin meaning and our embassy


king henry v

we are no tyrant but a christian king
unto whose grace our passion is as subject
as are our wretches fetter in our prisons
therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
tell us the dauphin mind


first ambassador

thus then in few
your highness lately sending into france
did claim some certain dukedoms in the right
of your great predecessor king edward the third
in answer of which claim the prince our master
says that you savour too much of your youth
and bids you be advised there nought in france
that can be with a nimble galliard won
you cannot revel into dukedoms there
he therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
this tun of treasure and in lieu of this
desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
hear no more of you this the dauphin speaks


king henry v

what treasure uncle


exeter

tennis-balls my liege


king henry v

we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us
his present and your pains we thank you for
when we have march our rackets to these balls
we will in france by god grace play a set
shall strike his father crown into the hazard
tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
that all the courts of france will be disturb
with chaces and we understand him well
how he comes oer us with our wilder days
not measuring what use we made of them
we never valued this poor seat of england
and therefore living hence did give ourself
to barbarous licence as tis ever common
that men are merriest when they are from home
but tell the dauphin i will keep my state
be like a king and show my sail of greatness
when i do rouse me in my throne of france
for that i have laid by my majesty
and plodded like a man for working-days
but i will rise there with so full a glory
that i will dazzle all the eyes of france
yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us
and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
hath turn his balls to gun-stones and his soul
shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows
shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands
mock mothers from their sons mock castles down
and some are yet ungotten and unborn
that shall have cause to curse the dauphin scorn
but this lies all within the will of god
to whom i do appeal and in whose name
tell you the dauphin i am coming on
to venge me as i may and to put forth
my rightful hand in a well-hallow cause
so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin
his jest will savour but of shallow wit
when thousands weep more than did laugh at it
convey them with safe conduct fare you well
exeunt ambassadors


exeter

this was a merry message


king henry v

we hope to make the sender blush at it
therefore my lords omit no happy hour
that may give furtherance to our expedition
for we have now no thought in us but france
save those to god that run before our business
therefore let our proportions for these wars
be soon collected and all things thought upon
that may with reasonable swiftness add
more feathers to our wings for god before
well chide this dauphin at his father door
therefore let every man now task his thought
that this fair action may on foot be brought

now all the youth of england are on fire
and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies
now thrive the armourers and honour thought
reigns solely in the breast of every man
they sell the pasture now to buy the horse
following the mirror of all christian kings
with winged heels as english mercuries
for now sits expectation in the air
and hides a sword from hilts unto the point
with crowns imperial crowns and coronets
promised to harry and his followers
the french advised by good intelligence
of this most dreadful preparation
shake in their fear and with pale policy
seek to divert the english purposes
o england model to thy inward greatness
like little body with a mighty heart
what mightst thou do that honour would thee do
were all thy children kind and natural
but see thy fault france hath in thee found out
a nest of hollow bosoms which he fills
with treacherous crowns and three corrupted men
one richard earl of cambridge and the second
henry lord scroop of masham and the third
sir thomas grey knight of northumberland
have for the gilt of france o guilt indeed
confirm conspiracy with fearful france
and by their hands this grace of kings must die
if hell and treason hold their promises
ere he take ship for france and in southampton
linger your patience on and well digest
the abuse of distance force a play
the sum is paid the traitors are agreed
the king is set from london and the scene
is now transported gentles to southampton
there is the playhouse now there must you sit
and thence to france shall we convey you safe
and bring you back charming the narrow seas
to give you gentle pass for if we may

fore god his grace is bold to trust these traitors


exeter

westmoreland

how smooth and even they do bear themselves
as if allegiance in their bosoms sat
crowned with faith and constant loyalty


bedford

the king hath note of all that they intend
by interception which they dream not of


exeter

nay but the man that was his bedfellow
whom he hath dull and cloy with gracious favours
that he should for a foreign purse so sell
his sovereign life to death and treachery
trumpets sound enter king henry v scroop cambridge grey and attendants


king henry v

now sits the wind fair and we will aboard
my lord of cambridge and my kind lord of masham
and you my gentle knight give me your thoughts
think you not that the powers we bear with us
will cut their passage through the force of france
doing the execution and the act
for which we have in head assembled them


scroop

no doubt my liege if each man do his best


king henry v

i doubt not that since we are well persuaded
we carry not a heart with us from hence
that grows not in a fair consent with ours
nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
success and conquest to attend on us


cambridge

never was monarch better fear and loved
than is your majesty there not i think a subject
that sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
under the sweet shade of your government


grey

true those that were your father enemies
have steep their galls in honey and do serve you
with hearts create of duty and of zeal


king henry v

we therefore have great cause of thankfulness
and shall forget the office of our hand
sooner than quittance of desert and merit
according to the weight and worthiness


scroop

so service shall with steeled sinews toil
and labour shall refresh itself with hope
to do your grace incessant services


king henry v

we judge no less uncle of exeter
enlarge the man committed yesterday
that rail against our person we consider
it was excess of wine that set him on
and on his more advice we pardon him


scroop

that mercy but too much security
let him be punish sovereign lest example
breed by his sufferance more of such a kind


king henry v

o let us yet be merciful


cambridge

so may your highness and yet punish too


grey

sir
you show great mercy if you give him life
after the taste of much correction


king henry v

alas your too much love and care of me
are heavy orisons gainst this poor wretch
if little faults proceeding on distemper
shall not be wink at how shall we stretch our eye
when capital crimes chew swallow and digested
appear before us well yet enlarge that man
though cambridge scroop and grey in their dear care
and tender preservation of our person
would have him punished and now to our french causes
who are the late commissioners


cambridge

i one my lord
your highness bade me ask for it to-day


scroop

so did you me my liege


grey

and i my royal sovereign


king henry v

then richard earl of cambridge there is yours
there yours lord scroop of masham and sir knight
grey of northumberland this same is yours
read them and know i know your worthiness
my lord of westmoreland and uncle exeter
we will aboard to night why how now gentlemen
what see you in those papers that you lose
so much complexion look ye how they change
their cheeks are paper why what read you there
that hath so cowarded and chased your blood
out of appearance


cambridge

i do confess my fault
and do submit me to your highness mercy


grey

scroop

to which we all appeal


king henry v

the mercy that was quick in us but late
by your own counsel is suppress and kill
you must not dare for shame to talk of mercy
for your own reasons turn into your bosoms
as dogs upon their masters worrying you
see you my princes and my noble peers
these english monsters my lord of cambridge here
you know how apt our love was to accord
to furnish him with all appertinents
belonging to his honour and this man
hath for a few light crowns lightly conspired
and sworn unto the practises of france
to kill us here in hampton to the which
this knight no less for bounty bound to us
than cambridge is hath likewise sworn but o
what shall i say to thee lord scroop thou cruel
ingrateful savage and inhuman creature
thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels
that knew the very bottom of my soul
that almost mightst have coin me into gold
wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use
may it be possible that foreign hire
could out of thee extract one spark of evil
that might annoy my finger tis so strange
that though the truth of it stands off as gross
as black and white my eye will scarcely see it
treason and murder ever kept together
as two yoke-devils sworn to either purpose
working so grossly in a natural cause
that admiration did not whoop at them
but thou gainst all proportion didst bring in
wonder to wait on treason and on murder
and whatsoever cunning fiend it was
that wrought upon thee so preposterously
hath got the voice in hell for excellence
all other devils that suggest by treasons
do botch and bungle up damnation
with patches colours and with forms being fetch
from glistering semblances of piety
but he that temper thee bade thee stand up
gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason
unless to dub thee with the name of traitor
if that same demon that hath gull thee thus
should with his lion gait walk the whole world
he might return to vasty tartar back
and tell the legions i can never win
a soul so easy as that englishman
o how hast thou with jealousy infected
the sweetness of affiance show men dutiful
why so didst thou seem they grave and learned
why so didst thou come they of noble family
why so didst thou seem they religious
why so didst thou or are they spare in diet
free from gross passion or of mirth or anger
constant in spirit not swerving with the blood
garnish and deck in modest complement
not working with the eye without the ear
and but in purged judgment trusting neither
such and so finely bolted didst thou seem
and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
to mark the full-fraught man and best indued
with some suspicion i will weep for thee
for this revolt of thine methinks is like
another fall of man their faults are open
arrest them to the answer of the law
and god acquit them of their practises


exeter

i arrest thee of high treason by the name of
richard earl of cambridge
i arrest thee of high treason by the name of
henry lord scroop of masham
i arrest thee of high treason by the name of
thomas grey knight of northumberland


scroop

our purposes god justly hath discover
and i repent my fault more than my death
which i beseech your highness to forgive
although my body pay the price of it


cambridge

for me the gold of france did not seduce
although i did admit it as a motive
the sooner to effect what i intended
but god be thanked for prevention
which i in sufferance heartily will rejoice
beseeching god and you to pardon me


grey

never did faithful subject more rejoice
at the discovery of most dangerous treason
than i do at this hour joy oer myself
prevented from a damned enterprise
my fault but not my body pardon sovereign


king henry v

god quit you in his mercy hear your sentence
you have conspired against our royal person
join with an enemy proclaim and from his coffers
received the golden earnest of our death
wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter
his princes and his peers to servitude
his subjects to oppression and contempt
and his whole kingdom into desolation
touching our person seek we no revenge
but we our kingdom safety must so tender
whose ruin you have sought that to her laws
we do deliver you get you therefore hence
poor miserable wretches to your death
the taste whereof god of his mercy give
you patience to endure and true repentance
of all your dear offences bear them hence
exeunt cambridge scroop and grey guarded
now lords for france the enterprise whereof
shall be to you as us like glorious
we doubt not of a fair and lucky war
since god so graciously hath brought to light
this dangerous treason lurking in our way
to hinder our beginnings we doubt not now
but every rub is smoothed on our way
then forth dear countrymen let us deliver
our puissance into the hand of god
putting it straight in expedition
cheerly to sea the signs of war advance
no king of england if not king of france

scene iv france the king palace

flourish enter the french king the dauphin the dukes of berri and bretagne the constable and others


king of france

thus comes the english with full power upon us
and more than carefully it us concerns
to answer royally in our defences
therefore the dukes of berri and of bretagne
of brabant and of orleans shall make forth
and you prince dauphin with all swift dispatch
to line and new repair our towns of war
with men of courage and with means defendant
for england his approaches makes as fierce
as waters to the sucking of a gulf
it fits us then to be as provident
as fear may teach us out of late examples
left by the fatal and neglected english
upon our fields


dauphin

my most redoubted father
it is most meet we arm us gainst the foe
for peace itself should not so dull a kingdom
though war nor no known quarrel were in question
but that defences musters preparations
should be maintain assembled and collected
as were a war in expectation
therefore i say tis meet we all go forth
to view the sick and feeble parts of france
and let us do it with no show of fear
no with no more than if we heard that england
were busied with a whitsun morris-dance
for my good liege she is so idly king
her sceptre so fantastically borne
by a vain giddy shallow humorous youth
that fear attends her not


constable

o peace prince dauphin
you are too much mistaken in this king
question your grace the late ambassadors
with what great state he heard their embassy
how well supplied with noble counsellors
how modest in exception and withal
how terrible in constant resolution
and you shall find his vanities forespent
were but the outside of the roman brutus
covering discretion with a coat of folly
as gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
that shall first spring and be most delicate


dauphin

well tis not so my lord high constable
but though we think it so it is no matter
in cases of defence tis best to weigh
the enemy more mighty than he seems
so the proportions of defence are fill
which of a weak or niggardly projection
doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting
a little cloth


king of france

think we king harry strong
and princes look you strongly arm to meet him
the kindred of him hath been flesh upon us
and he is bred out of that bloody strain
that haunted us in our familiar paths
witness our too much memorable shame
when cressy battle fatally was struck
and all our princes captiv by the hand
of that black name edward black prince of wales
whiles that his mountain sire on mountain standing
up in the air crown with the golden sun
saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him
mangle the work of nature and deface
the patterns that by god and by french fathers
had twenty years been made this is a stem
of that victorious stock and let us fear
the native mightiness and fate of him
enter a messenger


messenger

ambassadors from harry king of england
do crave admittance to your majesty


king of france

well give them present audience go and bring them
exeunt messenger and certain lords
you see this chase is hotly follow friends


dauphin

turn head and stop pursuit for coward dogs
most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
runs far before them good my sovereign
take up the english short and let them know
of what a monarchy you are the head
self-love my liege is not so vile a sin
as self-neglecting
re-enter lords with exeter and train


king of france

from our brother england


exeter

from him and thus he greets your majesty
he wills you in the name of god almighty
that you divest yourself and lay apart
the borrow glories that by gift of heaven
by law of nature and of nations long
to him and to his heirs namely the crown
and all wide-stretched honours that pertain
by custom and the ordinance of times
unto the crown of france that you may know
tis no sinister nor no awkward claim
pick from the worm-holes of long-vanish days
nor from the dust of old oblivion raked
he sends you this most memorable line
in every branch truly demonstrative
willing to overlook this pedigree
and when you find him evenly derived
from his most famed of famous ancestors
edward the third he bids you then resign
your crown and kingdom indirectly held
from him the native and true challenger


king of france

or else what follows


exeter

bloody constraint for if you hide the crown
even in your hearts there will he rake for it
therefore in fierce tempest is he coming
in thunder and in earthquake like a jove
that if requiring fail he will compel
and bids you in the bowels of the lord
deliver up the crown and to take mercy
on the poor souls for whom this hungry war
opens his vasty jaws and on your head
turning the widows tears the orphans cries
the dead men blood the pining maidens groans
for husbands fathers and betrothed lovers
that shall be swallow in this controversy
this is his claim his threatening and my message
unless the dauphin be in presence here
to whom expressly i bring greeting too


king of france

for us we will consider of this further
to-morrow shall you bear our full intent
back to our brother england


dauphin

for the dauphin
i stand here for him what to him from england


exeter

scorn and defiance slight regard contempt
and any thing that may not misbecome
the mighty sender doth he prize you at
thus says my king an if your father highness
do not in grant of all demands at large
sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty
hell call you to so hot an answer of it
that caves and womby vaultages of france
shall chide your trespass and return your mock
in second accent of his ordnance


dauphin

say if my father render fair return
it is against my will for i desire
nothing but odds with england to that end
as matching to his youth and vanity
i did present him with the paris balls


exeter

hell make your paris louvre shake for it
were it the mistress-court of mighty europe
and be assured youll find a difference
as we his subjects have in wonder found
between the promise of his greener days
and these he masters now now he weighs time
even to the utmost grain that you shall read
in your own losses if he stay in france


king of france

to-morrow shall you know our mind at full


exeter

dispatch us with all speed lest that our king
come here himself to question our delay
for he is footed in this land already


king of france

you shall be soon dispatch with fair conditions
a night is but small breath and little pause
to answer matters of this consequence

chorus

thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies
in motion of no less celerity
than that of thought suppose that you have seen
the well-appointed king at hampton pier
embark his royalty and his brave fleet
with silken streamers the young phoebus fanning
play with your fancies and in them behold
upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing
hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
to sounds confused behold the threaden sails
borne with the invisible and creeping wind
draw the huge bottoms through the furrow sea
breasting the lofty surge o do but think
you stand upon the ravage and behold
a city on the inconstant billows dancing
for so appears this fleet majestical
holding due course to harfleur follow follow
grapple your minds to sternage of this navy
and leave your england as dead midnight still
guarded with grandsires babies and old women
either past or not arrived to pith and puissance
for who is he whose chin is but enrich
with one appearing hair that will not follow
these cull and choice-drawn cavaliers to france
work work your thoughts and therein see a siege
behold the ordnance on their carriages
with fatal mouths gaping on girded harfleur
suppose the ambassador from the french comes back
tells harry that the king doth offer him
katharine his daughter and with her to dowry
some petty and unprofitable dukedoms
the offer likes not and the nimble gunner
with linstock now the devilish cannon touches

once more unto the breach dear friends once more
or close the wall up with our english dead
in peace there nothing so becomes a man
as modest stillness and humility
but when the blast of war blows in our ears
then imitate the action of the tiger
stiffen the sinews summon up the blood
disguise fair nature with hard-favour rage
then lend the eye a terrible aspect
let pry through the portage of the head
like the brass cannon let the brow oerwhelm it
as fearfully as doth a galled rock
oerhang and jutty his confounded base
swill with the wild and wasteful ocean
now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide
hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
to his full height on on you noblest english
whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof
fathers that like so many alexanders
have in these parts from morn till even fought
and sheathed their swords for lack of argument
dishonour not your mothers now attest
that those whom you call fathers did beget you
be copy now to men of grosser blood
and teach them how to war and you good yeoman
whose limbs were made in england show us here
the mettle of your pasture let us swear
that you are worth your breeding which i doubt not
for there is none of you so mean and base
that hath not noble lustre in your eyes
i see you stand like greyhounds in the slips
straining upon the start the game afoot
follow your spirit and upon this charge

the plain-song is most just for humours do abound

these be good humours your honour wins bad humours
exeunt all but boy


boy

as young as i am i have observed these three
swashers i am boy to them all three but all they
three though they would serve me could not be man
to me for indeed three such antics do not amount to
a man for bardolph he is white-livered and
red-faced by the means whereof a faces it out but
fights not for pistol he hath a killing tongue
and a quiet sword by the means whereof a breaks
words and keeps whole weapons for nym he hath
heard that men of few words are the best men and
therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest a
should be thought a coward but his few bad words
are matched with as few good deeds for a never
broke any man head but his own and that was
against a post when he was drunk they will steal
any thing and call it purchase bardolph stole a
lute-case bore it twelve leagues and sold it for
three half pence nym and bardolph are sworn
brothers in filching and in calais they stole a
fire-shovel i knew by that piece of service the
men would carry coals they would have me as
familiar with men pockets as their gloves or their
handkerchers which makes much against my manhood
if i should take from another pocket to put into
mine for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs i
must leave them and seek some better service
their villany goes against my weak stomach and
therefore i must cast it up

the governor and some citizens on the walls the english forces below enter king henry and his train


king henry v

how yet resolves the governor of the town
this is the latest parle we will admit
therefore to our best mercy give yourselves
or like to men proud of destruction
defy us to our worst for as i am a soldier
a name that in my thoughts becomes me best
if i begin the battery once again
i will not leave the half-achieved harfleur
till in her ashes she lie buried
the gates of mercy shall be all shut up
and the flesh soldier rough and hard of heart
in liberty of bloody hand shall range
with conscience wide as hell mowing like grass
your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants
what is it then to me if impious war
array in flames like to the prince of fiends
do with his smirch complexion all fell feats
enlink to waste and desolation
what ist to me when you yourselves are cause
if your pure maidens fall into the hand
of hot and forcing violation
what rein can hold licentious wickedness
when down the hill he holds his fierce career
we may as bootless spend our vain command
upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
as send precepts to the leviathan
to come ashore therefore you men of harfleur
take pity of your town and of your people
whiles yet my soldiers are in my command
whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
oerblows the filthy and contagious clouds
of heady murder spoil and villany
if not why in a moment look to see
the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters
your fathers taken by the silver beards
and their most reverend heads dash to the walls
your naked infants spitted upon pikes
whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
do break the clouds as did the wives of jewry
at herod bloody-hunting slaughtermen
what say you will you yield and this avoid
or guilty in defence be thus destroy


governor

scene v the same

enter the king of france the dauphin the duke of bourbon the constable of france and others


king of france

tis certain he hath pass the river somme


constable

and if he be not fought withal my lord
let us not live in france let us quit all
and give our vineyards to a barbarous people


dauphin

o dieu vivant shall a few sprays of us
the emptying of our fathers luxury
our scions put in wild and savage stock
spirt up so suddenly into the clouds
and overlook their grafters


bourbon

normans but bastard normans norman bastards
mort de ma vie if they march along
unfought withal but i will sell my dukedom
to buy a slobbery and a dirty farm
in that nook-shotten isle of albion


constable

dieu de batailles where have they this mettle
is not their climate foggy raw and dull
on whom as in despite the sun looks pale
killing their fruit with frowns can sodden water
a drench for sur-rein jades their barley-broth
decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat
and shall our quick blood spirited with wine
seem frosty o for honour of our land
let us not hang like roping icicles
upon our houses thatch whiles a more frosty people
sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields
poor we may call them in their native lords


dauphin

by faith and honour
our madams mock at us and plainly say
our mettle is bred out and they will give
their bodies to the lust of english youth
to new-store france with bastard warriors


bourbon

they bid us to the english dancing-schools
and teach lavoltas high and swift corantos
saying our grace is only in our heels
and that we are most lofty runaways


king of france

where is montjoy the herald speed him hence
let him greet england with our sharp defiance
up princes and with spirit of honour edged
more sharper than your swords hie to the field
charles delabreth high constable of france
you dukes of orleans bourbon and of berri
alencon brabant bar and burgundy
jaques chatillon rambures vaudemont
beaumont grandpre roussi and fauconberg
foix lestrale bouciqualt and charolois
high dukes great princes barons lords and knights
for your great seats now quit you of great shames
bar harry england that sweeps through our land
with pennons painted in the blood of harfleur
rush on his host as doth the melted snow
upon the valleys whose low vassal seat
the alps doth spit and void his rheum upon
go down upon him you have power enough
and in a captive chariot into rouen
bring him our prisoner


constable

this becomes the great
sorry am i his numbers are so few
his soldiers sick and famish in their march
for i am sure when he shall see our army
hell drop his heart into the sink of fear
and for achievement offer us his ransom


king of france

therefore lord constable haste on montjoy
and let him say to england that we send
to know what willing ransom he will give
prince dauphin you shall stay with us in rouen


dauphin

not so i do beseech your majesty


king of france

be patient for you shall remain with us
now forth lord constable and princes all
and quickly bring us word of england fall

scene vi the english camp in picardy

enter gower and fluellen meeting


gower

how now captain fluellen come you from the bridge


fluellen

i assure you there is very excellent services
committed at the bridge


gower

is the duke of exeter safe


fluellen

the duke of exeter is as magnanimous as agamemnon
and a man that i love and honour with my soul and my
heart and my duty and my life and my living and
my uttermost power he is not-god be praised and
blessed any hurt in the world but keeps the
bridge most valiantly with excellent discipline
there is an aunchient lieutenant there at the
pridge i think in my very conscience he is as
valiant a man as mark antony and he is a man of no
estimation in the world but did see him do as
gallant service


gower

what do you call him


fluellen

he is called aunchient pistol


gower

i know him not
enter pistol


fluellen

here is the man


pistol

captain i thee beseech to do me favours
the duke of exeter doth love thee well


fluellen

ay i praise god and i have merited some love at
his hands


pistol

bardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart
and of buxom valour hath by cruel fate
and giddy fortune furious fickle wheel
that goddess blind
that stands upon the rolling restless stone 


fluellen

by your patience aunchient pistol fortune is
painted blind with a muffler afore her eyes to
signify to you that fortune is blind and she is
painted also with a wheel to signify to you which
is the moral of it that she is turning and
inconstant and mutability and variation and her
foot look you is fixed upon a spherical stone
which rolls and rolls and rolls in good truth
the poet makes a most excellent description of it
fortune is an excellent moral


pistol

fortune is bardolph foe and frowns on him
for he hath stolen a pax and hanged must a be
a damned death
let gallows gape for dog let man go free
and let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate
but exeter hath given the doom of death
for pax of little price
therefore go speak the duke will hear thy voice
and let not bardolph vital thread be cut
with edge of penny cord and vile reproach
speak captain for his life and i will thee requite


fluellen

aunchient pistol i do partly understand your meaning


pistol

why then rejoice therefore


fluellen

certainly aunchient it is not a thing to rejoice
at for if look you he were my brother i would
desire the duke to use his good pleasure and put
him to execution for discipline ought to be used


pistol

die and be damn and figo for thy friendship


fluellen

it is well


pistol

the fig of spain
exit


fluellen

very good


gower

why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal i
remember him now a bawd a cutpurse


fluellen

ill assure you a uttered as brave words at the
bridge as you shall see in a summer day but it
is very well what he has spoke to me that is well
i warrant you when time is serve


gower

why tis a gull a fool a rogue that now and then
goes to the wars to grace himself at his return
into london under the form of a soldier and such
fellows are perfect in the great commanders names
and they will learn you by rote where services were
done at such and such a sconce at such a breach
at such a convoy who came off bravely who was
shot who disgraced what terms the enemy stood on
and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war
which they trick up with new-tuned oaths and what
a beard of the general cut and a horrid suit of
the camp will do among foaming bottles and
ale-washed wits is wonderful to be thought on but
you must learn to know such slanders of the age or
else you may be marvellously mistook


fluellen

i tell you what captain gower i do perceive he is
not the man that he would gladly make show to the
world he is if i find a hole in his coat i will
tell him my mind
drum heard
hark you the king is coming and i must speak with
him from the pridge
drum and colours enter king henry gloucester and soldiers
god pless your majesty


king henry v

how now fluellen camest thou from the bridge


fluellen

ay so please your majesty the duke of exeter has
very gallantly maintained the pridge the french is
gone off look you and there is gallant and most
prave passages marry th athversary was have
possession of the pridge but he is enforced to
retire and the duke of exeter is master of the
pridge i can tell your majesty the duke is a
prave man


king henry v

what men have you lost fluellen


fluellen

the perdition of th athversary hath been very
great reasonable great marry for my part i
think the duke hath lost never a man but one that
is like to be executed for robbing a church one
bardolph if your majesty know the man his face is
all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o
fire and his lips blows at his nose and it is like
a coal of fire sometimes plue and sometimes red
but his nose is executed and his fire out


king henry v

we would have all such offenders so cut off and we
give express charge that in our marches through the
country there be nothing compelled from the
villages nothing taken but paid for none of the
french upbraided or abused in disdainful language
for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the
gentler gamester is the soonest winner
tucket enter montjoy


montjoy

you know me by my habit


king henry v

well then i know thee what shall i know of thee


montjoy

my master mind


king henry v

unfold it


montjoy

thus says my king say thou to harry of england
though we seemed dead we did but sleep advantage
is a better soldier than rashness tell him we
could have rebuked him at harfleur but that we
thought not good to bruise an injury till it were
full ripe now we speak upon our cue and our voice
is imperial england shall repent his folly see
his weakness and admire our sufferance bid him
therefore consider of his ransom which must
proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we
have lost the disgrace we have digested which in
weight to re-answer his pettiness would bow under
for our losses his exchequer is too poor for the
effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom too
faint a number and for our disgrace his own
person kneeling at our feet but a weak and
worthless satisfaction to this add defiance and
tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his
followers whose condemnation is pronounced so far
my king and master so much my office


king henry v

what is thy name i know thy quality


montjoy

montjoy


king henry v

thou dost thy office fairly turn thee back
and tell thy king i do not seek him now
but could be willing to march on to calais
without impeachment for to say the sooth
though tis no wisdom to confess so much
unto an enemy of craft and vantage
my people are with sickness much enfeebled
my numbers lessened and those few i have
almost no better than so many french
who when they were in health i tell thee herald
i thought upon one pair of english legs
did march three frenchmen yet forgive me god
that i do brag thus this your air of france
hath blown that vice in me i must repent
go therefore tell thy master here i am
my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk
my army but a weak and sickly guard
yet god before tell him we will come on
though france himself and such another neighbour
stand in our way there for thy labour montjoy
go bid thy master well advise himself
if we may pass we will if we be hinder
we shall your tawny ground with your red blood
discolour and so montjoy fare you well
the sum of all our answer is but this
we would not seek a battle as we are
nor as we are we say we will not shun it
so tell your master


montjoy

i shall deliver so thanks to your highness
exit


gloucester

i hope they will not come upon us now


king henry v

we are in god hand brother not in theirs
march to the bridge it now draws toward night
beyond the river well encamp ourselves
and on to-morrow bid them march away

scene vii the french camp near agincourt

enter the constable of france the lord rambures orleans dauphin with others


constable

tut i have the best armour of the world would it were day


orleans

you have an excellent armour but let my horse have his due


constable

it is the best horse of europe


orleans

will it never be morning


dauphin

my lord of orleans and my lord high constable you
talk of horse and armour


orleans

you are as well provided of both as any prince in the world


dauphin

what a long night is this i will not change my
horse with any that treads but on four pasterns
ca ha he bounds from the earth as if his
entrails were hairs le cheval volant the pegasus
chez les narines de feu when i bestride him i
soar i am a hawk he trots the air the earth
sings when he touches it the basest horn of his
hoof is more musical than the pipe of hermes


orleans

he of the colour of the nutmeg


dauphin

and of the heat of the ginger it is a beast for
perseus he is pure air and fire and the dull
elements of earth and water never appear in him but
only in patient stillness while his rider mounts
him he is indeed a horse and all other jades you
may call beasts


constable

indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent horse


dauphin

it is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the
bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage


orleans

no more cousin


dauphin

nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the
rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary
deserved praise on my palfrey it is a theme as
fluent as the sea turn the sands into eloquent
tongues and my horse is argument for them all
tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on and for
a sovereign sovereign to ride on and for the
world familiar to us and unknown to lay apart
their particular functions and wonder at him i
once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus
wonder of nature 


orleans

i have heard a sonnet begin so to one mistress


dauphin

then did they imitate that which i composed to my
courser for my horse is my mistress


orleans

your mistress bears well


dauphin

me well which is the prescript praise and
perfection of a good and particular mistress


constable

nay for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly
shook your back


dauphin

so perhaps did yours


constable

mine was not bridled


dauphin

o then belike she was old and gentle and you rode
like a kern of ireland your french hose off and in
your straight strossers


constable

you have good judgment in horsemanship


dauphin

be warned by me then they that ride so and ride
not warily fall into foul bogs i had rather have
my horse to my mistress


constable

i had as lief have my mistress a jade


dauphin

i tell thee constable my mistress wears his own hair


constable

i could make as true a boast as that if i had a sow
to my mistress


dauphin

le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement et
la truie lavee au bourbier thou makest use of any thing


constable

yet do i not use my horse for my mistress or any
such proverb so little kin to the purpose


rambures

my lord constable the armour that i saw in your tent
to-night are those stars or suns upon it


constable

stars my lord


dauphin

some of them will fall to-morrow i hope


constable

and yet my sky shall not want


dauphin

that may be for you bear a many superfluously and
twere more honour some were away


constable

even as your horse bears your praises who would
trot as well were some of your brags dismounted


dauphin

would i were able to load him with his desert will
it never be day i will trot to-morrow a mile and
my way shall be paved with english faces


constable

i will not say so for fear i should be faced out of
my way but i would it were morning for i would
fain be about the ears of the english


rambures

who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners


constable

you must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them


dauphin

tis midnight ill go arm myself
exit


orleans

the dauphin longs for morning


rambures

he longs to eat the english


constable

i think he will eat all he kills


orleans

by the white hand of my lady he a gallant prince


constable

swear by her foot that she may tread out the oath


orleans

he is simply the most active gentleman of france


constable

doing is activity and he will still be doing


orleans

he never did harm that i heard of


constable

nor will do none to-morrow he will keep that good name still


orleans

i know him to be valiant


constable

i was told that  by one that knows him better than
you


orleans

what he


constable

marry he told me so himself and he said he cared
not who knew it


orleans

he needs not it is no hidden virtue in him


constable

by my faith sir but it is never any body saw it
but his lackey tis a hooded valour and when it
appears it will bate


orleans

ill will never said well


constable

i will cap that proverb with there is flattery in friendship


orleans

and i will take up that with give the devil his due


constable

well placed there stands your friend for the
devil have at the very eye of that proverb with a
pox of the devil


orleans

you are the better at proverbs by how much a
fool bolt is soon shot


constable

you have shot over


orleans

tis not the first time you were overshot
enter a messenger


messenger

my lord high constable the english lie within
fifteen hundred paces of your tents


constable

who hath measured the ground


messenger

the lord grandpre


constable

a valiant and most expert gentleman would it were
day alas poor harry of england he longs not for
the dawning as we do


orleans

what a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of
england to mope with his fat-brained followers so
far out of his knowledge


constable

if the english had any apprehension they would run away


orleans

that they lack for if their heads had any
intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy
head-pieces


rambures

that island of england breeds very valiant
creatures their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage


orleans

foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a
russian bear and have their heads crushed like
rotten apples you may as well say that a
valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion


constable

just just and the men do sympathize with the
mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on leaving
their wits with their wives and then give them
great meals of beef and iron and steel they will
eat like wolves and fight like devils


orleans

ay but these english are shrewdly out of beef


constable

then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs
to eat and none to fight now is it time to arm
come shall we about it


orleans

it is now two oclock but let me see by ten
we shall have each a hundred englishmen

act iv
prologue

enter chorus


chorus

now entertain conjecture of a time
when creeping murmur and the poring dark
fills the wide vessel of the universe
from camp to camp through the foul womb of night
the hum of either army stilly sounds
that the fixed sentinels almost receive
the secret whispers of each other watch
fire answers fire and through their paly flames
each battle sees the other umber face
steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs
piercing the night dull ear and from the tents
the armourers accomplishing the knights
with busy hammers closing rivets up
give dreadful note of preparation
the country cocks do crow the clocks do toll
and the third hour of drowsy morning name
proud of their numbers and secure in soul
the confident and over-lusty french
do the low-rated english play at dice
and chide the cripple tardy-gaited night
who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp
so tediously away the poor condemned english
like sacrifices by their watchful fires
sit patiently and inly ruminate
the morning danger and their gesture sad
investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats
presenteth them unto the gazing moon
so many horrid ghosts o now who will behold
the royal captain of this ruin band
walking from watch to watch from tent to tent
let him cry praise and glory on his head
for forth he goes and visits all his host
bids them good morrow with a modest smile
and calls them brothers friends and countrymen
upon his royal face there is no note
how dread an army hath enrounded him
nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
unto the weary and all-watched night
but freshly looks and over-bears attaint
with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty
that every wretch pining and pale before
beholding him plucks comfort from his looks
a largess universal like the sun
his liberal eye doth give to every one
thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all
behold as may unworthiness define
a little touch of harry in the night
and so our scene must to the battle fly
where o for pity we shall much disgrace
with four or five most vile and ragged foils
right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous
the name of agincourt yet sit and see
minding true things by what their mockeries be
exit

scene i the english camp at agincourt

enter king henry bedford and gloucester


king henry v

gloucester tis true that we are in great danger
the greater therefore should our courage be
good morrow brother bedford god almighty
there is some soul of goodness in things evil
would men observingly distil it out
for our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers
which is both healthful and good husbandry
besides they are our outward consciences
and preachers to us all admonishing
that we should dress us fairly for our end
thus may we gather honey from the weed
and make a moral of the devil himself
enter erpingham
good morrow old sir thomas erpingham
a good soft pillow for that good white head
were better than a churlish turf of france


erpingham

not so my liege this lodging likes me better
since i may say now lie i like a king


king henry v

tis good for men to love their present pains
upon example so the spirit is eased
and when the mind is quicken out of doubt
the organs though defunct and dead before
break up their drowsy grave and newly move
with casted slough and fresh legerity
lend me thy cloak sir thomas brothers both
commend me to the princes in our camp
do my good morrow to them and anon
desire them an to my pavilion

i kiss his dirty shoe and from heart-string
i love the lovely bully what is thy name

it sorts well with your fierceness
enter fluellen and gower


gower

captain fluellen


fluellen

so in the name of jesu christ speak lower it is
the greatest admiration of the universal world when
the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the
wars is not kept if you would take the pains but to
examine the wars of pompey the great you shall
find i warrant you that there is no tiddle toddle
nor pibble pabble in pompey camp i warrant you
you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the
cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety
of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise


gower

why the enemy is loud you hear him all night


fluellen

if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating
coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also
look you be an ass and a fool and a prating
coxcomb in your own conscience now


gower

i will speak lower


fluellen

i pray you and beseech you that you will
exeunt gower and fluellen


king henry v

though it appear a little out of fashion
there is much care and valour in this welshman
enter three soldiers john bates alexander court and michael williams


court

brother john bates is not that the morning which
breaks yonder


bates

i think it be but we have no great cause to desire
the approach of day


williams

we see yonder the beginning of the day but i think
we shall never see the end of it who goes there


king henry v

a friend


williams

under what captain serve you


king henry v

under sir thomas erpingham


williams

a good old commander and a most kind gentleman i
pray you what thinks he of our estate


king henry v

even as men wrecked upon a sand that look to be
washed off the next tide


bates

he hath not told his thought to the king


king henry v

no nor it is not meet he should for though i
speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i
am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the
element shows to him as it doth to me all his
senses have but human conditions his ceremonies
laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and
though his affections are higher mounted than ours
yet when they stoop they stoop with the like
wing therefore when he sees reason of fears as we
do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish
as ours are yet in reason no man should possess
him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing
it should dishearten his army


bates

he may show what outward courage he will but i
believe as cold a night as tis he could wish
himself in thames up to the neck and so i would he
were and i by him at all adventures so we were quit here


king henry v

by my troth i will speak my conscience of the king
i think he would not wish himself any where but
where he is


bates

then i would he were here alone so should he be
sure to be ransomed and a many poor men lives saved


king henry v

i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here
alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men
minds methinks i could not die any where so
contented as in the king company his cause being
just and his quarrel honourable


williams

that more than we know


bates

ay or more than we should seek after for we know
enough if we know we are the kings subjects if
his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes
the crime of it out of us


williams

but if the cause be not good the king himself hath
a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and
arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join
together at the latter day and cry all we died at
such a place some swearing some crying for a
surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind
them some upon the debts they owe some upon their
children rawly left i am afeard there are few die
well that die in a battle for how can they
charitably dispose of any thing when blood is their
argument now if these men do not die well it
will be a black matter for the king that led them to
it whom to disobey were against all proportion of
subjection


king henry v

so if a son that is by his father sent about
merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the
imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be
imposed upon his father that sent him or if a
servant under his master command transporting a
sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in
many irreconciled iniquities you may call the
business of the master the author of the servant
damnation but this is not so the king is not
bound to answer the particular endings of his
soldiers the father of his son nor the master of
his servant for they purpose not their death when
they purpose their services besides there is no
king be his cause never so spotless if it come to
the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all
unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them
the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder
some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of
perjury some making the wars their bulwark that
have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with
pillage and robbery now if these men have
defeated the law and outrun native punishment
though they can outstrip men they have no wings to
fly from god war is his beadle war is vengeance
so that here men are punished for before-breach of
the king laws in now the king quarrel where
they feared the death they have borne life away
and where they would be safe they perish then if
they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of
their damnation than he was before guilty of those
impieties for the which they are now visited every
subject duty is the king but every subject
soul is his own therefore should every soldier in
the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every
mote out of his conscience and dying so death
is to him advantage or not dying the time was
blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained
and in him that escapes it were not sin to think
that making god so free an offer he let him
outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach
others how they should prepare


williams

tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon
his own head the king is not to answer it


bates

but i do not desire he should answer for me and
yet i determine to fight lustily for him


king henry v

i myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed


williams

ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but
when our throats are cut he may be ransomed and we
neer the wiser


king henry v

if i live to see it i will never trust his word after


williams

you pay him then that a perilous shot out of an
elder-gun that a poor and private displeasure can
do against a monarch you may as well go about to
turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a
peacock feather youll never trust his word
after come tis a foolish saying


king henry v

your reproof is something too round i should be
angry with you if the time were convenient


williams

let it be a quarrel between us if you live


king henry v

i embrace it


williams

how shall i know thee again


king henry v

give me any gage of thine and i will wear it in my
bonnet then if ever thou darest acknowledge it i
will make it my quarrel


williams

here my glove give me another of thine


king henry v

there


williams

this will i also wear in my cap if ever thou come
to me and say after to-morrow this is my glove
by this hand i will take thee a box on the ear


king henry v

if ever i live to see it i will challenge it


williams

thou darest as well be hanged


king henry v

well i will do it though i take thee in the
king company


williams

keep thy word fare thee well


bates

be friends you english fools be friends we have
french quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckon


king henry v

indeed the french may lay twenty french crowns to
one they will beat us for they bear them on their
shoulders but it is no english treason to cut
french crowns and to-morrow the king himself will
be a clipper
exeunt soldiers
upon the king let us our lives our souls
our debts our careful wives
our children and our sins lay on the king
we must bear all o hard condition
twin-born with greatness subject to the breath
of every fool whose sense no more can feel
but his own wringing what infinite heart-ease
must kings neglect that private men enjoy
and what have kings that privates have not too
save ceremony save general ceremony
and what art thou thou idle ceremony
what kind of god art thou that suffer more
of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers
what are thy rents what are thy comings in
o ceremony show me but thy worth
what is thy soul of adoration
art thou aught else but place degree and form
creating awe and fear in other men
wherein thou art less happy being fear
than they in fearing
what drink thou oft instead of homage sweet
but poison flattery o be sick great greatness
and bid thy ceremony give thee cure
think thou the fiery fever will go out
with titles blown from adulation
will it give place to flexure and low bending
canst thou when thou command the beggar knee
command the health of it no thou proud dream
that play so subtly with a king repose
i am a king that find thee and i know
tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball
the sword the mace the crown imperial
the intertissued robe of gold and pearl
the farced title running fore the king
the throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp
that beats upon the high shore of this world
no not all these thrice-gorgeous ceremony
not all these laid in bed majestical
can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave
who with a body fill and vacant mind
gets him to rest cramm with distressful bread
never sees horrid night the child of hell
but like a lackey from the rise to set
sweats in the eye of phoebus and all night
sleeps in elysium next day after dawn
doth rise and help hyperion to his horse
and follows so the ever-running year
with profitable labour to his grave
and but for ceremony such a wretch
winding up days with toil and nights with sleep
had the fore-hand and vantage of a king
the slave a member of the country peace
enjoys it but in gross brain little wots
what watch the king keeps to maintain the peace
whose hours the peasant best advantages

five hundred poor i have in yearly pay
who twice a-day their wither hands hold up
toward heaven to pardon blood and i have built

sing still for richard soul more will i do

enter messenger


messenger

the english are embattled you french peers


constable

to horse you gallant princes straight to horse
do but behold yon poor and starved band
and your fair show shall suck away their souls
leaving them but the shales and husks of men
there is not work enough for all our hands
scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
to give each naked curtle-axe a stain
that our french gallants shall to-day draw out
and sheathe for lack of sport let us but blow on them
the vapour of our valour will oerturn them
tis positive gainst all exceptions lords
that our superfluous lackeys and our peasants
who in unnecessary action swarm
about our squares of battle were enow
to purge this field of such a hilding foe
though we upon this mountain basis by
took stand for idle speculation
but that our honours must not what to say
a very little little let us do
and all is done then let the trumpets sound
the tucket sonance and the note to mount
for our approach shall so much dare the field
that england shall couch down in fear and yield
enter grandpre


grandpre

why do you stay so long my lords of france
yon island carrions desperate of their bones
ill-favouredly become the morning field
their ragged curtains poorly are let loose
and our air shakes them passing scornfully
big mars seems bankrupt in their beggar host
and faintly through a rusty beaver peeps
the horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks
with torch-staves in their hand and their poor jades
lob down their heads dropping the hides and hips
the gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes
and in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit
lies foul with chew grass still and motionless
and their executors the knavish crows
fly oer them all impatient for their hour
description cannot suit itself in words
to demonstrate the life of such a battle
in life so lifeless as it shows itself


constable

they have said their prayers and they stay for death


dauphin

shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
and give their fasting horses provender
and after fight with them


constable

i stay but for my guidon to the field
i will the banner from a trumpet take
and use it for my haste come come away
the sun is high and we outwear the day

bedford

the king himself is rode to view their battle


westmoreland

of fighting men they have full three score thousand


exeter

salisbury

god arm strike with us tis a fearful odds
god be wi you princes all ill to my charge
if we no more meet till we meet in heaven
then joyfully my noble lord of bedford
my dear lord gloucester and my good lord exeter
and my kind kinsman warriors all adieu


bedford

farewell good salisbury and good luck go with thee


exeter

farewell kind lord fight valiantly to-day
and yet i do thee wrong to mind thee of it
for thou art framed of the firm truth of valour
exit salisbury


bedford

princely in both
enter the king


westmoreland

o that we now had here
but one ten thousand of those men in england
that do no work to-day


king henry v

what he that wishes so
my cousin westmoreland no my fair cousin
if we are mark to die we are enow
to do our country loss and if to live
the fewer men the greater share of honour
god will i pray thee wish not one man more
by jove i am not covetous for gold
nor care i who doth feed upon my cost
it yearns me not if men my garments wear
such outward things dwell not in my desires
but if it be a sin to covet honour
i am the most offending soul alive
no faith my coz wish not a man from england
god peace i would not lose so great an honour
as one man more methinks would share from me
for the best hope i have o do not wish one more
rather proclaim it westmoreland through my host
that he which hath no stomach to this fight
let him depart his passport shall be made
and crowns for convoy put into his purse
we would not die in that man company
that fears his fellowship to die with us
this day is called the feast of crispian
he that outlives this day and comes safe home
will stand a tip-toe when the day is named
and rouse him at the name of crispian
he that shall live this day and see old age
will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours
and say to-morrow is saint crispian
then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars
and say these wounds i had on crispin day
old men forget yet all shall be forgot
but hell remember with advantages
what feats he did that day then shall our names
familiar in his mouth as household words
harry the king bedford and exeter
warwick and talbot salisbury and gloucester
be in their flowing cups freshly remember
this story shall the good man teach his son
and crispin crispian shall neer go by
from this day to the ending of the world
but we in it shall be remember
we few we happy few we band of brothers
for he to-day that sheds his blood with me
shall be my brother be he neer so vile
this day shall gentle his condition
and gentlemen in england now a-bed
shall think themselves accursed they were not here
and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
that fought with us upon saint crispin day
re-enter salisbury


salisbury

my sovereign lord bestow yourself with speed
the french are bravely in their battles set
and will with all expedience charge on us


king henry v

all things are ready if our minds be so


westmoreland

king henry v

thou dost not wish more help from england coz


westmoreland

without more help could fight this royal battle

which likes me better than to wish us one
you know your places god be with you all
tucket enter montjoy


montjoy

once more i come to know of thee king harry
if for thy ransom thou wilt now compound
before thy most assured overthrow
for certainly thou art so near the gulf
thou needs must be englutted besides in mercy
the constable desires thee thou wilt mind
thy followers of repentance that their souls
may make a peaceful and a sweet retire
from off these fields where wretches their poor bodies
must lie and fester


king henry v

who hath sent thee now


montjoy

the constable of france


king henry v

i pray thee bear my former answer back
bid them achieve me and then sell my bones
good god why should they mock poor fellows thus
the man that once did sell the lion skin
while the beast lived was killed with hunting him
a many of our bodies shall no doubt
find native graves upon the which i trust
shall witness live in brass of this day work
and those that leave their valiant bones in france
dying like men though buried in your dunghills
they shall be famed for there the sun shall greet them
and draw their honours reeking up to heaven
leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime
the smell whereof shall breed a plague in france
mark then abounding valour in our english
that being dead like to the bullet grazing
break out into a second course of mischief
killing in relapse of mortality
let me speak proudly tell the constable
we are but warriors for the working-day
our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch
with rainy marching in the painful field
there not a piece of feather in our host 
good argument i hope we will not fly 
and time hath worn us into slovenry
but by the mass our hearts are in the trim
and my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night
theyll be in fresher robes or they will pluck
the gay new coats oer the french soldiers heads
and turn them out of service if they do this 
as if god please they shall my ransom then
will soon be levied herald save thou thy labour
come thou no more for ransom gentle herald
they shall have none i swear but these my joints
which if they have as i will leave em them
shall yield them little tell the constable


montjoy

i shall king harry and so fare thee well
thou never shalt hear herald any more

i saw him down thrice up again and fighting
from helmet to the spur all blood he was


exeter

in which array brave soldier doth he lie
larding the plain and by his bloody side
yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds
the noble earl of suffolk also lies
suffolk first died and york all haggled over
comes to him where in gore he lay insteep
and takes him by the beard kisses the gashes
that bloodily did spawn upon his face
and cries aloud tarry dear cousin suffolk
my soul shall thine keep company to heaven
tarry sweet soul for mine then fly abreast
as in this glorious and well-foughten field
we kept together in our chivalry
upon these words i came and cheer him up
he smiled me in the face raught me his hand
and with a feeble gripe says ear my lord
commend my service to me sovereign
so did he turn and over suffolk neck
he threw his wounded arm and kiss his lips
and so espoused to death with blood he seal
a testament of noble-ending love
the pretty and sweet manner of it forced
those waters from me which i would have stopp
but i had not so much of man in me
and all my mother came into mine eyes
and gave me up to tears


king henry v

i blame you not

cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha done

soldier to cut his prisoner throat o tis a
gallant king

chorus

vouchsafe to those that have not read the story
that i may prompt them and of such as have
i humbly pray them to admit the excuse
of time of numbers and due course of things
which cannot in their huge and proper life
be here presented now we bear the king
toward calais grant him there there seen
heave him away upon your winged thoughts
athwart the sea behold the english beach
pales in the flood with men with wives and boys
whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth sea
which like a mighty whiffler fore the king
seems to prepare his way so let him land
and solemnly see him set on to london
so swift a pace hath thought that even now
you may imagine him upon blackheath
where that his lords desire him to have borne
his bruised helmet and his bended sword
before him through the city he forbids it
being free from vainness and self-glorious pride
giving full trophy signal and ostent
quite from himself to god but now behold
in the quick forge and working-house of thought
how london doth pour out her citizens
the mayor and all his brethren in best sort
like to the senators of the antique rome
with the plebeians swarming at their heels
go forth and fetch their conquering caesar in
as by a lower but loving likelihood
were now the general of our gracious empress
as in good time he may from ireland coming
bringing rebellion broached on his sword
how many would the peaceful city quit
to welcome him much more and much more cause
did they this harry now in london place him
as yet the lamentation of the french
invites the king of england stay at home
the emperor coming in behalf of france
to order peace between them and omit
all the occurrences whatever chanced
till harry back-return again to france
there must we bring him and myself have play
the interim by remembering you tis past
then brook abridgment and your eyes advance
after your thoughts straight back again to france

enter at one door king henry exeter bedford  gloucester warwick westmoreland and other lords  at another the french king queen isabel the  princess katharine alice and other ladies the duke of burgundy and his train


king henry v

peace to this meeting wherefore we are met
unto our brother france and to our sister
health and fair time of day joy and good wishes
to our most fair and princely cousin katharine
and as a branch and member of this royalty
by whom this great assembly is contrived
we do salute you duke of burgundy
and princes french and peers health to you all


king of france

right joyous are we to behold your face
most worthy brother england fairly met
so are you princes english every one


queen isabel

so happy be the issue brother england
of this good day and of this gracious meeting
as we are now glad to behold your eyes
your eyes which hitherto have borne in them
against the french that met them in their bent
the fatal balls of murdering basilisks
the venom of such looks we fairly hope
have lost their quality and that this day
shall change all griefs and quarrels into love


king henry v

to cry amen to that thus we appear


queen isabel

you english princes all i do salute you


burgundy

my duty to you both on equal love
great kings of france and england that i have labour
with all my wits my pains and strong endeavours
to bring your most imperial majesties
unto this bar and royal interview
your mightiness on both parts best can witness
since then my office hath so far prevail
that face to face and royal eye to eye
you have congreeted let it not disgrace me
if i demand before this royal view
what rub or what impediment there is
why that the naked poor and mangled peace
dear nurse of arts and joyful births
should not in this best garden of the world
our fertile france put up her lovely visage
alas she hath from france too long been chased
and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps
corrupting in its own fertility
her vine the merry cheerer of the heart
unpruned dies her hedges even-pleach
like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair
put forth disorder twigs her fallow leas
the darnel hemlock and rank fumitory
doth root upon while that the coulter rusts
that should deracinate such savagery
the even mead that erst brought sweetly forth
the freckled cowslip burnet and green clover
wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank
conceives by idleness and nothing teems
but hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs
losing both beauty and utility
and as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges
defective in their natures grow to wildness
even so our houses and ourselves and children
have lost or do not learn for want of time
the sciences that should become our country
but grow like savages as soldiers will
that nothing do but meditate on blood 
to swearing and stern looks diffused attire
and every thing that seems unnatural
which to reduce into our former favour
you are assembled and my speech entreats
that i may know the let why gentle peace
should not expel these inconveniences
and bless us with her former qualities


king henry v

if duke of burgundy you would the peace
whose want gives growth to the imperfections
which you have cited you must buy that peace
with full accord to all our just demands
whose tenors and particular effects
you have enscheduled briefly in your hands


burgundy

the king hath heard them to the which as yet
there is no answer made


king henry v

well then the peace
which you before so urged lies in his answer


king of france

i have but with a cursorary eye
oerglanced the articles pleaseth your grace
to appoint some of your council presently
to sit with us once more with better heed
to re-survey them we will suddenly
pass our accept and peremptory answer


king henry v

brother we shall go uncle exeter
and brother clarence and you brother gloucester
warwick and huntingdon go with the king
and take with you free power to ratify
augment or alter as your wisdoms best
shall see advantageable for our dignity
any thing in or out of our demands
and well consign thereto will you fair sister
go with the princes or stay here with us


queen isabel

our gracious brother i will go with them
haply a woman voice may do some good
when articles too nicely urged be stood on


king henry v

yet leave our cousin katharine here with us
she is our capital demand comprised
within the fore-rank of our articles


queen isabel

she hath good leave
exeunt all except henry katharine and alice


king henry v

fair katharine and most fair
will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
such as will enter at a lady ear
and plead his love-suit to her gentle heart


katharine

your majesty shall mock at me i cannot speak your england


king henry v

o fair katharine if you will love me soundly with
your french heart i will be glad to hear you
confess it brokenly with your english tongue do
you like me kate


katharine

pardonnez-moi i cannot tell vat is like me


king henry v

an angel is like you kate and you are like an angel


katharine

que dit-il que je suis semblable a les anges


alice

oui vraiment sauf votre grace ainsi dit-il


king henry v

i said so dear katharine and i must not blush to
affirm it


katharine

o bon dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de
tromperies


king henry v

what says she fair one that the tongues of men
are full of deceits


alice

oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of
deceits dat is de princess


king henry v

the princess is the better englishwoman i faith
kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding i am
glad thou canst speak no better english for if
thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king
that thou wouldst think i had sold my farm to buy my
crown i know no ways to mince it in love but
directly to say i love you then if you urge me
farther than to say o you in faith i wear out
my suit give me your answer i faith do and so
clap hands and a bargain how say you lady


katharine

sauf votre honneur me understand vell


king henry v

marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for
your sake kate why you undid me for the one i
have neither words nor measure and for the other i
have no strength in measure yet a reasonable
measure in strength if i could win a lady at
leap-frog or by vaulting into my saddle with my
armour on my back under the correction of bragging
be it spoken i should quickly leap into a wife
or if i might buffet for my love or bound my horse
for her favours i could lay on like a butcher and
sit like a jack-an-apes never off but before god
kate i cannot look greenly nor gasp out my
eloquence nor i have no cunning in protestation
only downright oaths which i never use till urged
nor never break for urging if thou canst love a
fellow of this temper kate whose face is not worth
sun-burning that never looks in his glass for love
of any thing he sees there let thine eye be thy
cook i speak to thee plain soldier if thou canst
love me for this take me if not to say to thee
that i shall die is true but for thy love by the
lord no yet i love thee too and while thou
livest dear kate take a fellow of plain and
uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee
right because he hath not the gift to woo in other
places for these fellows of infinite tongue that
can rhyme themselves into ladies favours they do
always reason themselves out again what a
speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad a
good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a
black beard will turn white a curled pate will grow
bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax
hollow but a good heart kate is the sun and the
moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it
shines bright and never changes but keeps his
course truly if thou would have such a one take
me and take me take a soldier take a soldier
take a king and what sayest thou then to my love
speak my fair and fairly i pray thee


katharine

is it possible dat i sould love de enemy of france


king henry v

no it is not possible you should love the enemy of
france kate but in loving me you should love
the friend of france for i love france so well that
i will not part with a village of it i will have it
all mine and kate when france is mine and i am
yours then yours is france and you are mine


katharine

i cannot tell vat is dat


king henry v

no kate i will tell thee in french which i am
sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married
wife about her husband neck hardly to be shook
off je quand sur le possession de france et quand
vous avez le possession de moi let me see what
then saint denis be my speed donc votre est
france et vous etes mienne it is as easy for me
kate to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much
more french i shall never move thee in french
unless it be to laugh at me


katharine

sauf votre honneur le francois que vous parlez il
est meilleur que langlois lequel je parle


king henry v

no faith ist not kate but thy speaking of my
tongue and i thine most truly-falsely must needs
be granted to be much at one but kate dost thou
understand thus much english canst thou love me


katharine

i cannot tell


king henry v

can any of your neighbours tell kate ill ask
them come i know thou lovest me and at night
when you come into your closet youll question this
gentlewoman about me and i know kate you will to
her dispraise those parts in me that you love with
your heart but good kate mock me mercifully the
rather gentle princess because i love thee
cruelly if ever thou beest mine kate as i have a
saving faith within me tells me thou shalt i get
thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs
prove a good soldier-breeder shall not thou and i
between saint denis and saint george compound a
boy half french half english that shall go to
constantinople and take the turk by the beard
shall we not what sayest thou my fair
flower-de-luce


katharine

i do not know dat


king henry v

no tis hereafter to know but now to promise do
but now promise kate you will endeavour for your
french part of such a boy and for my english moiety
take the word of a king and a bachelor how answer
you la plus belle katharine du monde mon tres cher
et devin deesse


katharine

your majestee ave fausse french enough to deceive de
most sage demoiselle dat is en france


king henry v

now fie upon my false french by mine honour in
true english i love thee kate by which honour i
dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to
flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor
and untempering effect of my visage now beshrew
my father ambition he was thinking of civil wars
when he got me therefore was i created with a
stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when
i come to woo ladies i fright them but in faith
kate the elder i wax the better i shall appear
my comfort is that old age that ill layer up of
beauty can do no more spoil upon my face thou
hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou
shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better
and therefore tell me most fair katharine will you
have me put off your maiden blushes avouch the
thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress
take me by the hand and say harry of england i am
thine which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine
ear withal but i will tell thee aloud england is
thine ireland is thine france is thine and harry
plantagenet is thine who though i speak it before
his face if he be not fellow with the best king
thou shalt find the best king of good fellows
come your answer in broken music for thy voice is
music and thy english broken therefore queen of
all katharine break thy mind to me in broken
english wilt thou have me


katharine

baisant la main dune de votre seigeurie indigne
serviteur excusez-moi je vous supplie mon
tres-puissant seigneur


king henry v

katharine

les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant
leur noces il nest pas la coutume de france


king henry v

madam my interpreter what says she


alice

dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of
france i cannot tell vat is baiser en anglish


king henry v

to kiss


alice

your majesty entendre bettre que moi


king henry v

it is not a fashion for the maids in france to kiss
before they are married would she say


alice

oui vraiment


king henry v

o kate nice customs curtsy to great kings dear
kate you and i cannot be confined within the weak
list of a country fashion we are the makers of
manners kate and the liberty that follows our
places stops the mouth of all find-faults as i will
do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your
country in denying me a kiss therefore patiently
and yielding
kissing her
you have witchcraft in your lips kate there is
more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the
tongues of the french council and they should
sooner persuade harry of england than a general
petition of monarchs here comes your father
re-enter the french king and his queen burgundy and other lords


burgundy

god save your majesty my royal cousin teach you
our princess english


king henry v

i would have her learn my fair cousin how
perfectly i love her and that is good english


burgundy

is she not apt


king henry v

our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not
smooth so that having neither the voice nor the
heart of flattery about me i cannot so conjure up
the spirit of love in her that he will appear in
his true likeness


burgundy

pardon the frankness of my mirth if i answer you
for that if you would conjure in her you must
make a circle if conjure up love in her in his true
likeness he must appear naked and blind can you
blame her then being a maid yet rosed over with the
virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the
appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing
self it were my lord a hard condition for a maid
to consign to


king henry v

yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces


burgundy

they are then excused my lord when they see not
what they do


king henry v

then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking


burgundy

i will wink on her to consent my lord if you will
teach her to know my meaning for maids well
summered and warm kept are like flies at
bartholomew-tide blind though they have their
eyes and then they will endure handling which
before would not abide looking on


king henry v

this moral ties me over to time and a hot summer
and so i shall catch the fly your cousin in the
latter end and she must be blind too


burgundy

as love is my lord before it loves


king henry v

it is so and you may some of you thank love for
my blindness who cannot see many a fair french city
for one fair french maid that stands in my way


french king

yes my lord you see them perspectively the cities
turned into a maid for they are all girdled with
maiden walls that war hath never entered


king henry v

shall kate be my wife


french king

so please you


king henry v

i am content so the maiden cities you talk of may
wait on her so the maid that stood in the way for
my wish shall show me the way to my will


french king

we have consented to all terms of reason


king henry v

ist so my lords of england


westmoreland

the king hath granted every article
his daughter first and then in sequel all
according to their firm proposed natures


exeter

only he hath not yet subscribed this
where your majesty demands that the king of france
having any occasion to write for matter of grant
shall name your highness in this form and with this
addition in french notre trescher fils henri roi
dangleterre heritier de france and thus in
latin praeclarissimus filius noster henricus rex
angliae et haeres franciae


french king

nor this i have not brother so denied
but your request shall make me let it pass


king henry v

i pray you then in love and dear alliance
let that one article rank with the rest
and thereupon give me your daughter


french king

take her fair son and from her blood raise up
issue to me that the contending kingdoms
of france and england whose very shores look pale
with envy of each other happiness
may cease their hatred and this dear conjunction
plant neighbourhood and christian-like accord
in their sweet bosoms that never war advance
his bleeding sword twixt england and fair france


all

amen


king henry v

now welcome kate and bear me witness all
that here i kiss her as my sovereign queen
flourish


queen isabel

to make divorce of their incorporate league

the life of king henry the eighth

act i
prologue

i come no more to make you laugh things now
that bear a weighty and a serious brow
sad high and working full of state and woe
such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow
we now present those that can pity here
may if they think it well let fall a tear
the subject will deserve it such as give
their money out of hope they may believe
may here find truth too those that come to see
only a show or two and so agree
the play may pass if they be still and willing
ill undertake may see away their shilling
richly in two short hours only they
that come to hear a merry bawdy play
a noise of targets or to see a fellow
in a long motley coat guarded with yellow
will be deceived for gentle hearers know
to rank our chosen truth with such a show
as fool and fight is beside forfeiting
our own brains and the opinion that we bring
to make that only true we now intend
will leave us never an understanding friend
therefore for goodness sake and as you are known
the first and happiest hearers of the town
be sad as we would make ye think ye see
the very persons of our noble story
as they were living think you see them great
and follow with the general throng and sweat
of thousand friends then in a moment see
how soon this mightiness meets misery
and if you can be merry then ill say
a man may weep upon his wedding-day

scene i london an ante-chamber in the palace

enter norfolk at one door at the other buckingham and abergavenny


buckingham

good morrow and well met how have ye done
since last we saw in france


norfolk

i thank your grace
healthful and ever since a fresh admirer
of what i saw there


buckingham

an untimely ague
stay me a prisoner in my chamber when
those suns of glory those two lights of men
met in the vale of andren


norfolk

twixt guynes and arde
i was then present saw them salute on horseback
beheld them when they lighted how they clung
in their embracement as they grew together
which had they what four throned ones could have weigh
such a compounded one


buckingham

all the whole time
i was my chamber prisoner


norfolk

then you lost
the view of earthly glory men might say
till this time pomp was single but now married
to one above itself each following day
became the next day master till the last
made former wonders its to-day the french
all clinquant all in gold like heathen gods
shone down the english and to-morrow they
made britain india every man that stood
show like a mine their dwarfish pages were
as cherubins all guilt the madams too
not used to toil did almost sweat to bear
the pride upon them that their very labour
was to them as a painting now this masque
was cried incomparable and the ensuing night
made it a fool and beggar the two kings
equal in lustre were now best now worst
as presence did present them him in eye
still him in praise and being present both
twas said they saw but one and no discerner
durst wag his tongue in censure when these suns 
for so they phrase em by their heralds challenged
the noble spirits to arms they did perform
beyond thought compass that former fabulous story
being now seen possible enough got credit
that bevis was believed


buckingham

o you go far


norfolk

as i belong to worship and affect
in honour honesty the tract of every thing
would by a good discourser lose some life
which action self was tongue to all was royal
to the disposing of it nought rebell
order gave each thing view the office did
distinctly his full function


buckingham

who did guide
i mean who set the body and the limbs
of this great sport together as you guess


norfolk

one certes that promises no element
in such a business


buckingham

i pray you who my lord


norfolk

all this was order by the good discretion
of the right reverend cardinal of york


buckingham

the devil speed him no man pie is freed
from his ambitious finger what had he
to do in these fierce vanities i wonder
that such a keech can with his very bulk
take up the rays o the beneficial sun
and keep it from the earth


norfolk

surely sir
there in him stuff that puts him to these ends
for being not propp by ancestry whose grace
chalks successors their way nor call upon
for high feats done to the crown neither allied
for eminent assistants but spider-like
out of his self-drawing web he gives us note
the force of his own merit makes his way
a gift that heaven gives for him which buys
a place next to the king


abergavenny

i cannot tell
what heaven hath given him let some graver eye
pierce into that but i can see his pride
peep through each part of him whence has he that
if not from hell the devil is a niggard
or has given all before and he begins
a new hell in himself


buckingham

why the devil
upon this french going out took he upon him
without the privity o the king to appoint
who should attend on him he makes up the file
of all the gentry for the most part such
to whom as great a charge as little honour
he meant to lay upon and his own letter
the honourable board of council out
must fetch him in the papers


abergavenny

i do know
kinsmen of mine three at the least that have
by this so sickened their estates that never
they shall abound as formerly


buckingham

o many
have broke their backs with laying manors on em
for this great journey what did this vanity
but minister communication of
a most poor issue


norfolk

grievingly i think
the peace between the french and us not values
the cost that did conclude it


buckingham

every man
after the hideous storm that follow was
a thing inspired and not consulting broke
into a general prophecy that this tempest
dashing the garment of this peace aboded
the sudden breach ont


norfolk

which is budded out
for france hath flaw the league and hath attach
our merchants goods at bourdeaux


abergavenny

is it therefore
the ambassador is silenced


norfolk

marry ist


abergavenny

a proper title of a peace and purchased
at a superfluous rate


buckingham

why all this business
our reverend cardinal carried


norfolk

like it your grace
the state takes notice of the private difference
betwixt you and the cardinal i advise you 
and take it from a heart that wishes towards you
honour and plenteous safety that you read
the cardinal malice and his potency
together to consider further that
what his high hatred would effect wants not
a minister in his power you know his nature
that he revengeful and i know his sword
hath a sharp edge it long and t may be said
it reaches far and where twill not extend
thither he darts it bosom up my counsel
youll find it wholesome lo where comes that rock
that i advise your shunning
enter cardinal wolsey the purse borne before him  certain of the guard and two secretaries with  papers cardinal wolsey in his passage fixeth his  eye on buckingham and buckingham on him both full of disdain


cardinal wolsey

the duke of buckingham surveyor ha

cardinal wolsey

is he in person ready


first secretary

ay please your grace


cardinal wolsey

well we shall then know more and buckingham
shall lessen this big look
exeunt cardinal wolsey and his train


buckingham

this butcher cur is venom-mouth and i
have not the power to muzzle him therefore best
not wake him in his slumber a beggar book
outworths a noble blood


norfolk

what are you chafed
ask god for temperance that the appliance only
which your disease requires


buckingham

i read in looks
matter against me and his eye reviled
me as his abject object at this instant
he bores me with some trick he gone to the king
ill follow and outstare him


norfolk

stay my lord
and let your reason with your choler question
what tis you go about to climb steep hills
requires slow pace at first anger is like
a full-hot horse who being allow his way
self-mettle tires him not a man in england
can advise me like you be to yourself
as you would to your friend


buckingham

ill to the king
and from a mouth of honour quite cry down
this ipswich fellow insolence or proclaim
there difference in no persons


norfolk

be advised
heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
that it do singe yourself we may outrun
by violent swiftness that which we run at
and lose by over-running know you not
the fire that mounts the liquor til run oer
in seeming to augment it wastes it be advised
i say again there is no english soul
more stronger to direct you than yourself
if with the sap of reason you would quench
or but allay the fire of passion


buckingham

sir
i am thankful to you and ill go along
by your prescription but this top-proud fellow
whom from the flow of gall i name not but
from sincere motions by intelligence
and proofs as clear as founts in july when
we see each grain of gravel i do know
to be corrupt and treasonous


norfolk

say not treasonous


buckingham

to the king ill sayt and make my vouch as strong
as shore of rock attend this holy fox
or wolf or both for he is equal ravenous
as he is subtle and as prone to mischief
as able to performt his mind and place
infecting one another yea reciprocally 
only to show his pomp as well in france
as here at home suggests the king our master
to this last costly treaty the interview
that swallow so much treasure and like a glass
did break i the rinsing


norfolk

faith and so it did


buckingham

pray give me favour sir this cunning cardinal
the articles o the combination drew
as himself pleased and they were ratified
as he cried thus let be to as much end
as give a crutch to the dead but our count-cardinal
has done this and tis well for worthy wolsey
who cannot err he did it now this follows 
which as i take it is a kind of puppy
to the old dam treason charles the emperor
under pretence to see the queen his aunt 
for twas indeed his colour but he came
to whisper wolsey here makes visitation
his fears were that the interview betwixt
england and france might through their amity
breed him some prejudice for from this league
peep harms that menaced him he privily
deals with our cardinal and as i trow 
which i do well for i am sure the emperor
paid ere he promised whereby his suit was granted
ere it was ask but when the way was made
and paved with gold the emperor thus desired
that he would please to alter the king course
and break the foresaid peace let the king know
as soon he shall by me that thus the cardinal
does buy and sell his honour as he pleases
and for his own advantage


norfolk

i am sorry
to hear this of him and could wish he were
something mistaken int


buckingham

no not a syllable
i  do pronounce him in that very shape
he shall appear in proof
enter brandon a sergeant-at-arms before him and two or three of the guard


brandon

sergeant

of hereford stafford and northampton i

king henry viii

never name to us you have half our power
the other moiety ere you ask is given
repeat your will and take it


queen katharine

thank your majesty
that you would love yourself and in that love
not unconsider leave your honour nor
the dignity of your office is the point
of my petition


king henry viii

lady mine proceed


queen katharine

i am solicited not by a few
and those of true condition that your subjects
are in great grievance there have been commissions
sent down among em which hath flaw the heart
of all their loyalties wherein although
my good lord cardinal they vent reproaches
most bitterly on you as putter on
of these exactions yet the king our master 
whose honour heaven shield from soil even he
escapes not
language unmannerly yea such which breaks
the sides of loyalty and almost appears
in loud rebellion


norfolk

not almost appears
it doth appear for upon these taxations
the clothiers all not able to maintain
the many to them longing have put off
the spinsters carders fullers weavers who
unfit for other life compell by hunger
and lack of other means in desperate manner
daring the event to the teeth are all in uproar
and danger serves among then


king henry viii

taxation
wherein and what taxation my lord cardinal
you that are blamed for it alike with us
know you of this taxation


cardinal wolsey

please you sir
i know but of a single part in aught
pertains to the state and front but in that file
where others tell steps with me


queen katharine

no my lord
you know no more than others but you frame
things that are known alike which are not wholesome
to those which would not know them and yet must
perforce be their acquaintance these exactions
whereof my sovereign would have note they are
most pestilent to the bearing and to bear em
the back is sacrifice to the load they say
they are devised by you or else you suffer
too hard an exclamation


king henry viii

still exaction
the nature of it in what kind let know
is this exaction


queen katharine

i am much too venturous
in tempting of your patience but am bolden
under your promised pardon the subjects grief
comes through commissions which compel from each
the sixth part of his substance to be levied
without delay and the pretence for this
is named your wars in france this makes bold mouths
tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze
allegiance in them their curses now
live where their prayers did and it come to pass
this tractable obedience is a slave
to each incensed will i would your highness
would give it quick consideration for
there is no primer business


king henry viii

by my life
this is against our pleasure


cardinal wolsey

and for me
i have no further gone in this than by
a single voice and that not pass me but
by learned approbation of the judges if i am
traduced by ignorant tongues which neither know
my faculties nor person yet will be
the chronicles of my doing let me say
tis but the fate of place and the rough brake
that virtue must go through we must not stint
our necessary actions in the fear
to cope malicious censurers which ever
as ravenous fishes do a vessel follow
that is new-trimm but benefit no further
than vainly longing what we oft do best
by sick interpreters once weak ones is
not ours or not allow what worst as oft
hitting a grosser quality is cried up
for our best act if we shall stand still
in fear our motion will be mock or carp at
we should take root here where we sit or sit
state-statues only


king henry viii

things done well
and with a care exempt themselves from fear
things done without example in their issue
are to be fear have you a precedent
of this commission i believe not any
we must not rend our subjects from our laws
and stick them in our will sixth part of each
a trembling contribution why we take
from every tree lop bark and part o the timber
and though we leave it with a root thus hack
the air will drink the sap to every county
where this is question send our letters with
free pardon to each man that has denied
the force of this commission pray look tot
i put it to your care


cardinal wolsey

a word with you
to the secretary
let there be letters writ to every shire
of the king grace and pardon the grieved commons
hardly conceive of me let it be noised
that through our intercession this revokement
and pardon comes i shall anon advise you
further in the proceeding
exit secretary
enter surveyor


queen katharine

i am sorry that the duke of buckingham
is run in your displeasure


king henry viii

it grieves many
the gentleman is learn and a most rare speaker
to nature none more bound his training such
that he may furnish and instruct great teachers
and never seek for aid out of himself yet see
when these so noble benefits shall prove
not well disposed the mind growing once corrupt
they turn to vicious forms ten times more ugly
than ever they were fair this man so complete
who was enroll mongst wonders and when we
almost with ravish listening could not find
his hour of speech a minute he my lady
hath into monstrous habits put the graces
that once were his and is become as black
as if besmear in hell sit by us you shall hear 
this was his gentleman in trust of him
things to strike honour sad bid him recount
the fore-recited practises whereof
we cannot feel too little hear too much


cardinal wolsey

stand forth and with bold spirit relate what you
most like a careful subject have collected
out of the duke of buckingham


king henry viii

speak freely


surveyor

first it was usual with him every day
it would infect his speech that if the king
should without issue die hell carry it so
to make the sceptre his these very words
ive heard him utter to his son-in-law
lord abergavenny to whom by oath he menaced
revenge upon the cardinal


cardinal wolsey

please your highness note
this dangerous conception in this point
not friended by by his wish to your high person
his will is most malignant and it stretches
beyond you to your friends


queen katharine

my learn lord cardinal
deliver all with charity


king henry viii

speak on
how grounded he his title to the crown
upon our fail to this point hast thou heard him
at any time speak aught


surveyor

he was brought to this
by a vain prophecy of nicholas hopkins


king henry viii

what was that hopkins


surveyor

sir a chartreux friar
his confessor who fed him every minute
with words of sovereignty


king henry viii

how know thou this


surveyor

not long before your highness sped to france
the duke being at the rose within the parish
saint lawrence poultney did of me demand
what was the speech among the londoners
concerning the french journey i replied
men fear the french would prove perfidious
to the king danger presently the duke
said twas the fear indeed and that he doubted
twould prove the verity of certain words
spoke by a holy monk that oft says he
hath sent to me wishing me to permit
john de la car my chaplain a choice hour
to hear from him a matter of some moment
whom after under the confession seal
he solemnly had sworn that what he spoke
my chaplain to no creature living but
to me should utter with demure confidence
this pausingly ensued neither the king nor heirs
tell you the duke shall prosper bid him strive
to gain the love o the commonalty the duke
shall govern england


queen katharine

if i know you well
you were the duke surveyor and lost your office
on the complaint o the tenants take good heed
you charge not in your spleen a noble person
and spoil your nobler soul i say take heed
yes heartily beseech you


king henry viii

let him on
go forward


surveyor

on my soul ill speak but truth
i told my lord the duke by the devil illusions
the monk might be deceived and that twas dangerous for him
to ruminate on this so far until
it forged him some design which being believed
it was much like to do he answer tush
it can do me no damage adding further
that had the king in his last sickness fail
the cardinal and sir thomas lovell heads
should have gone off


king henry viii

ha what so rank ah ha
there mischief in this man canst thou say further


surveyor

i can my liege


king henry viii

proceed


surveyor

being at greenwich
after your highness had reproved the duke
about sir william blomer 


king henry viii

i remember
of such a time being my sworn servant
the duke retain him his but on what hence


surveyor

if quoth he i for this had been committed
as to the tower i thought i would have play
the part my father meant to act upon
the usurper richard who being at salisbury
made suit to come in presence which if granted
as he made semblance of his duty would
have put his knife to him


king henry viii

a giant traitor


cardinal wolsey

now madam may his highness live in freedom
and this man out of prison


queen katharine

god mend all


king henry viii

there something more would out of thee what say


surveyor

after the duke his father with the knife
he stretch him and with one hand on his dagger
another spread on breast mounting his eyes
he did discharge a horrible oath whose tenor
was were he evil used he would outgo
his father by as much as a performance
does an irresolute purpose


king henry viii

there his period
to sheathe his knife in us he is attach
call him to present trial if he may
find mercy in the law tis his if none
let him not seek t of us by day and night
he traitor to the height

chamberlain

as far as i see all the good our english

pertaining thereunto as fights and fireworks
abusing better men than they can be
out of a foreign wisdom renouncing clean
the faith they have in tennis and tall stockings
short blister breeches and those types of travel
and understand again like honest men
or pack to their old playfellows there i take it
they may cum privilegio wear away
the lag end of their lewdness and be laugh at


sands

tis time to give em physic their diseases
are grown so catching


chamberlain

what a loss our ladies
will have of these trim vanities


lovell

act ii
scene i westminster a street

enter two gentlemen meeting


first gentleman

whither away so fast


second gentleman

o god save ye
even to the hall to hear what shall become
of the great duke of buckingham


first gentleman

ill save you
that labour sir all now done but the ceremony
of bringing back the prisoner


second gentleman

were you there


first gentleman

yes indeed was i


second gentleman

pray speak what has happen


first gentleman

you may guess quickly what


second gentleman

is he found guilty


first gentleman

yes truly is he and condemn upont


second gentleman

i am sorry fort


first gentleman

so are a number more


second gentleman

but pray how pass it


first gentleman

ill tell you in a little the great duke
came to the bar where to his accusations
he pleaded still not guilty and alleged
many sharp reasons to defeat the law
the king attorney on the contrary
urged on the examinations proofs confessions
of divers witnesses which the duke desired
to have brought viva voce to his face
at which appear against him his surveyor
sir gilbert peck his chancellor and john car
confessor to him with that devil-monk
hopkins that made this mischief


second gentleman

that was he
that fed him with his prophecies


first gentleman

the same
all these accused him strongly which he fain
would have flung from him but indeed he could not
and so his peers upon this evidence
have found him guilty of high treason much
he spoke and learnedly for life but all
was either pitied in him or forgotten


second gentleman

after all this how did he bear himself


first gentleman

when he was brought again to the bar to hear
his knell rung out his judgment he was stirr
with such an agony he sweat extremely
and something spoke in choler ill and hasty
but he fell to himself again and sweetly
in all the rest show a most noble patience


second gentleman

i do not think he fears death


first gentleman

sure he does not
he never was so womanish the cause
he may a little grieve at


second gentleman

certainly
the cardinal is the end of this


first gentleman

tis likely
by all conjectures first kildare attainder
then deputy of ireland who removed
earl surrey was sent thither and in haste too
lest he should help his father


second gentleman

that trick of state
was a deep envious one


first gentleman

at his return
no doubt he will requite it this is noted
and generally whoever the king favours
the cardinal instantly will find employment
and far enough from court too


second gentleman

all the commons
hate him perniciously and o my conscience
wish him ten fathom deep this duke as much
they love and dote on call him bounteous buckingham
the mirror of all courtesy 


first gentleman

stay there sir
and see the noble ruin man you speak of
enter buckingham from his arraignment tip-staves  before him the axe with the edge towards him  halberds on each side accompanied with lovell vaux sands and common people


second gentleman

let stand close and behold him


buckingham

all good people
you that thus far have come to pity me
hear what i say and then go home and lose me
i have this day received a traitor judgment
and by that name must die yet heaven bear witness
and if i have a co nscience let it sink me
even as the axe falls if i be not faithful
the law i bear no malice for my death
t has done upon the premises but justice
but those that sought it i could wish more christians
be what they will i heartily forgive em
yet let em look they glory not in mischief
nor build their evils on the graves of great men
for then my guiltless blood must cry against em
for further life in this world i neer hope
nor will i sue although the king have mercies
more than i dare make faults you few that loved me
and dare be bold to weep for buckingham
his noble friends and fellows whom to leave
is only bitter to him only dying
go with me like good angels to my end
and as the long divorce of steel falls on me
make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice
and lift my soul to heaven lead on o god name


lovell

i do beseech your grace for charity
if ever any malice in your heart
were hid against me now to forgive me frankly


buckingham

sir thomas lovell i as free forgive you
as i would be forgiven i forgive all
there cannot be those numberless offences
gainst me that i cannot take peace with
no black envy
shall mark my grave commend me to his grace
and if he speak of buckingham pray tell him
you met him half in heaven my vows and prayers
yet are the king and till my soul forsake
shall cry for blessings on him may he live
longer than i have time to tell his years
ever beloved and loving may his rule be
and when old time shall lead him to his end
goodness and he fill up one monument


lovell

to the water side i must conduct your grace
then give my charge up to sir nicholas vaux
who undertakes you to your end


vaux

prepare there
the duke is coming see the barge be ready
and fit it with such furniture as suits
the greatness of his person


buckingham

nay sir nicholas
let it alone my state now will but mock me
when i came hither i was lord high constable
and duke of buckingham now poor edward bohun
yet i am richer than my base accusers
that never knew what truth meant i now seal it
and with that blood will make em one day groan fort
my noble father henry of buckingham
who first raised head against usurping richard
flying for succor to his servant banister
being distress was by that wretch betray
and without trial fell god peace be with him
henry the seventh succeeding truly pitying
my father loss like a most royal prince
restored me to my honours and out of ruins
made my name once more noble now his son
henry the eighth life honour name and all
that made me happy at one stroke has taken
for ever from the world i had my trial
and must needs say a noble one which makes me
a little happier than my wretched father
yet thus far we are one in fortunes both
fell by our servants by those men we loved most
a most unnatural and faithless service
heaven has an end in all yet you that hear me
this from a dying man receive as certain
where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
be sure you be not loose for those you make friends
and give your hearts to when they once perceive
the least rub in your fortunes fall away
like water from ye never found again
but where they mean to sink ye all good people
pray for me i must now forsake ye the last hour
of my long weary life is come upon me farewell
and when you would say something that is sad
speak how i fell i have done and god forgive me
exeunt buckingham and train


first gentleman

o this is full of pity sir it calls
i fear too many curses on their beads
that were the authors


second gentleman

if the duke be guiltless
tis full of woe yet i can give you inkling
of an ensuing evil if it fall
greater than this


first gentleman

good angels keep it from us
what may it be you do not doubt my faith sir


second gentleman

this secret is so weighty twill require
a strong faith to conceal it


first gentleman

let me have it
i do not talk much


second gentleman

i am confident
you shall sir did you not of late days hear
a buzzing of a separation
between the king and katharine


first gentleman

yes but it held not
for when the king once heard it out of anger
he sent command to the lord mayor straight
to stop the rumor and allay those tongues
that durst disperse it


second gentleman

but that slander sir
is found a truth now for it grows again
fresher than eer it was and held for certain
the king will venture at it either the cardinal
or some about him near have out of malice
to the good queen possess him with a scruple
that will undo her to confirm this too
cardinal campeius is arrived and lately
as all think for this business


first gentleman

tis the cardinal
and merely to revenge him on the emperor
for not bestowing on him at his asking
the archbishopric of toledo this is purposed


second gentleman

i think you have hit the mark but ist not cruel
that she should feel the smart of this the cardinal
will have his will and she must fall


first gentleman

tis woful
we are too open here to argue this
let think in private more

his highness having lived so long with her and she

pronounce dishonour of her by my life
she never knew harm-doing o now after
so many courses of the sun enthroned
still growing in a majesty and pomp the which
to leave a thousand-fold more bitter than
tis sweet at first to acquire after this process
to give her the avaunt it is a pity
would move a monster


old lady

hearts of most hard temper
melt and lament for her


anne

o god will much better

yet if that quarrel fortune do divorce
it from the bearer tis a sufferance panging
as soul and body severing


old lady

alas poor lady
she a stranger now again


anne

so much the more
must pity drop upon her verily
i swear tis better to be lowly born
and range with humble livers in content
than to be perk up in a glistering grief
and wear a golden sorrow


old lady

our content
is our best having


anne

by my troth and maidenhead
i would not be a queen


old lady

beshrew me i would
and venture maidenhead fort and so would you
for all this spice of your hypocrisy
you that have so fair parts of woman on you
have too a woman heart which ever yet
affected eminence wealth sovereignty
which to say sooth are blessings and which gifts
saving your mincing the capacity
of your soft cheveril conscience would receive
if you might please to stretch it


anne

anne

i do not know
what kind of my obedience i should tender
more than my all is nothing nor my prayers
are not words duly hallow nor my wishes
more worth than empty vanities yet prayers and wishes
are all i can return beseech your lordship

as from a blushing handmaid to his highness
whose health and royalty i pray for


chamberlain

lady

a better wife let him in nought be trusted
for speaking false in that thou art alone
if thy rare qualities sweet gentleness
thy meekness saint-like wife-like government
obeying in commanding and thy parts
sovereign and pious else could speak thee out
the queen of earthly queens she noble born
and like her true nobility she has
carried herself towards me


cardinal wolsey

most gracious sir
in humblest manner i require your highness
that it shall please you to declare in hearing
of all these ears for where i am robb and bound
there must i be unloosed although not there
at once and fully satisfied whether ever i
did broach this business to your highness or
laid any scruple in your way which might
induce you to the question ont or ever
have to you but with thanks to god for such
a royal lady spake one the least word that might
be to the prejudice of her present state
or touch of her good person


king henry viii

my lord cardinal
i do excuse you yea upon mine honour
i free you fromt you are not to be taught
that you have many enemies that know not
why they are so but like to village-curs
bark when their fellows do by some of these
the queen is put in anger youre excused
but will you be more justified you ever
have wish the sleeping of this business never desired
it to be stirr but oft have hinder oft
the passages made toward it on my honour
i speak my good lord cardinal to this point
and thus far clear him now what moved me tot
i will be bold with time and your attention
then mark the inducement thus it came give heed tot
my conscience first received a tenderness
scruple and prick on certain speeches utter
by the bishop of bayonne then french ambassador
who had been hither sent on the debating
a marriage twixt the duke of orleans and
our daughter mary i the progress of this business
ere a determinate resolution he
i mean the bishop did require a respite
wherein he might the king his lord advertise
whether our daughter were legitimate
respecting this our marriage with the dowager
sometimes our brother wife this respite shook
the bosom of my conscience enter me
yea with a splitting power and made to tremble
the region of my breast which forced such way
that many mazed considerings did throng
and press in with this caution first methought
i stood not in the smile of heaven who had
commanded nature that my lady womb
if it conceived a male child by me should
do no more offices of life tot than
the grave does to the dead for her male issue
or died where they were made or shortly after
this world had air them hence i took a thought
this was a judgment on me that my kingdom
well worthy the best heir o the world should not
be gladded int by me then follows that
i weigh the danger which my realms stood in
by this my issue fail and that gave to me
many a groaning throe thus hulling in
the wild sea of my conscience i did steer
toward this remedy whereupon we are
now present here together that to say
i meant to rectify my conscience which
i then did feel full sick and yet not well 
by all the reverend fathers of the land
and doctors learn first i began in private
with you my lord of lincoln you remember
how under my oppression i did reek
when i first moved you


lincoln

very well my liege


king henry viii

i have spoke long be pleased yourself to say
how far you satisfied me


lincoln

so please your highness
the question did at first so stagger me
bearing a state of mighty moment int
and consequence of dread that i committed
the daring counsel which i had to doubt
and did entreat your highness to this course
which you are running here


king henry viii

i then moved you
my lord of canterbury and got your leave
to make this present summons unsolicited
i left no reverend person in this court
but by particular consent proceeded
under your hands and seals therefore go on
for no dislike i the world against the person
of the good queen but the sharp thorny points
of my alleged reasons drive this forward
prove but our marriage lawful by my life
and kingly dignity we are contented
to wear our mortal state to come with her
katharine our queen before the primest creature
that paragon o the world


cardinal campeius

so please your highness
the queen being absent tis a needful fitness
that we adjourn this court till further day
meanwhile must be an earnest motion
made to the queen to call back her appeal
she intends unto his holiness


king henry viii

asidei may perceive
these cardinals trifle with me i abhor
this dilatory sloth and tricks of rome
my learn and well-beloved servant cranmer
prithee return with thy approach i know
my comfort comes along break up the court
i say set on

the full cause of our coming


queen katharine

speak it here
there nothing i have done yet o my conscience
deserves a corner would all other women
could speak this with as free a soul as i do
my lords i care not so much i am happy
above a number if my actions
were tried by every tongue every eye saw em
envy and base opinion set against em
i know my life so even if your business
seek me out and that way i am wife in
out with it boldly truth loves open dealing


cardinal wolsey

tanta est erga te mentis integritas regina
serenissima 


queen katharine

o good my lord no latin
i am not such a truant since my coming
as not to know the language i have lived in
a strange tongue makes my cause more strange
suspicious
pray speak in english here are some will thank you
if you speak truth for their poor mistress sake
believe me she has had much wrong lord cardinal
the willing sin i ever yet committed
may be absolved in english


cardinal wolsey

noble lady
i am sorry my integrity should breed
and service to his majesty and you
so deep suspicion where all faith was meant
we come not by the way of accusation
to taint that honour every good tongue blesses
nor to betray you any way to sorrow
you have too much good lady but to know
how you stand minded in the weighty difference
between the king and you and to deliver
like free and honest men our just opinions
and comforts to your cause


cardinal campeius

most honour madam
my lord of york out of his noble nature
zeal and obedience he still bore your grace
forgetting like a good man your late censure
both of his truth and him which was too far
offers as i do in a sign of peace
his service and his counsel


queen katharine

asideto betray me 
my lords i thank you both for your good wills
ye speak like honest men pray god ye prove so
but how to make ye suddenly an answer
in such a point of weight so near mine honour 
more near my life i fear with my weak wit
and to such men of gravity and learning
in truth i know not i was set at work
among my maids full little god knows looking
either for such men or such business
for her sake that i have been for i feel
the last fit of my greatness good your graces
let me have time and counsel for my cause
alas i am a woman friendless hopeless


cardinal wolsey

madam you wrong the king love with these fears
your hopes and friends are infinite


queen katharine

in england
but little for my profit can you think lords
that any englishman dare give me counsel
or be a known friend gainst his highness pleasure
though he be grown so desperate to be honest
and live a subject nay forsooth my friends
they that must weigh out my afflictions
they that my trust must grow to live not here
they are as all my other comforts far hence
in mine own country lords


cardinal campeius

i would your grace
would leave your griefs and take my counsel


queen katharine

how sir


cardinal campeius

put your main cause into the king protection
he loving and most gracious twill be much
both for your honour better and your cause
for if the trial of the law oertake ye
youll part away disgraced


cardinal wolsey

he tells you rightly


queen katharine

ye tell me what ye wish for both my ruin
is this your christian counsel out upon ye
heaven is above all yet there sits a judge
that no king can corrupt


cardinal campeius

your rage mistakes us


queen katharine

the more shame for ye holy men i thought ye
upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues
but cardinal sins and hollow hearts i fear ye
mend em for shame my lords is this your comfort
the cordial that ye bring a wretched lady
a woman lost among ye laugh at scorn
i will not wish ye half my miseries
i have more charity but say i warn ye
take heed for heaven sake take heed lest at once
the burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye


cardinal wolsey

madam this is a mere distraction
you turn the good we offer into envy


queen katharine

ye turn me into nothing woe upon ye
and all such false professors would you have me 
if you have any justice any pity
if ye be any thing but churchmen habits 
put my sick cause into his hands that hates me
alas has banish me his bed already
his love too long ago i am old my lords
and all the fellowship i hold now with him
is only my obedience what can happen
to me above this wretchedness all your studies
make me a curse like this


cardinal campeius

your fears are worse


queen katharine

have i lived thus long let me speak myself
since virtue finds no friends a wife a true one
a woman i dare say without vain-glory
never yet branded with suspicion
have i with all my full affections
still met the king loved him next heaven
obey him
been out of fondness superstitious to him
almost forgot my prayers to content him
and am i thus rewarded tis not well lords
bring me a constant woman to her husband
one that neer dream a joy beyond his pleasure
and to that woman when she has done most
yet will i add an honour a great patience


cardinal wolsey

madam you wander from the good we aim at


queen katharine

my lord i dare not make myself so guilty
to give up willingly that noble title
your master wed me to nothing but death
shall eer divorce my dignities


cardinal wolsey

pray hear me


queen katharine

would i had never trod this english earth
or felt the flatteries that grow upon it
ye have angels faces but heaven knows your hearts
what will become of me now wretched lady
i am the most unhappy woman living
alas poor wenches where are now your fortunes
shipwreck upon a kingdom where no pity
no friend no hope no kindred weep for me
almost no grave allow me like the lily
that once was mistress of the field and flourish
ill hang my head and perish


cardinal wolsey

if your grace
could but be brought to know our ends are honest
yould feel more comfort why should we good lady
upon what cause wrong you alas our places
the way of our profession is against it
we are to cure such sorrows not to sow em
for goodness sake consider what you do
how you may hurt yourself ay utterly
grow from the king acquaintance by this carriage
the hearts of princes kiss obedience
so much they love it but to stubborn spirits
they swell and grow as terrible as storms
i know you have a gentle noble temper
a soul as even as a calm pray think us
those we profess peace-makers friends and servants


cardinal campeius

madam youll find it so you wrong your virtues
with these weak women fears a noble spirit
as yours was put into you ever casts
such doubts as false coin from it the king loves you
beware you lose it not for us if you please
to trust us in your business we are ready
to use our utmost  studies in your service


queen katharine

do what ye will my lords and pray forgive me
if i have used myself unmannerly
you know i am a woman lacking wit
to make a seemly answer to such persons
pray do my service to his majesty
he has my heart yet and shall have my prayers
while i shall have my life come reverend fathers
bestow your counsels on me she now begs
that little thought when she set footing here
she should have bought her dignities so dear

to his own portion and what expense by the hour
seems to flow from him how i the name of thrift
does he rake this together now my lords
saw you the cardinal


norfolk

my lord we have
stood here observing him some strange commotion
is in his brain he bites his lip and starts
stops on a sudden looks upon the ground
then lays his finger on his temple straight
springs out into fast gait then stops again
strikes his breast hard and anon he casts
his eye against the moon in most strange postures
we have seen him set himself


king henry viii

it may well be
there is a mutiny in mind this morning
papers of state he sent me to peruse
as i required and wot you what i found
there on my conscience put unwittingly
forsooth an inventory thus importing
the several parcels of his plate his treasure
rich stuffs and ornaments of household which
i find at such proud rate that it out-speaks
possession of a subject


norfolk

it heaven will
some spirit put this paper in the packet
to bless your eye withal


king henry viii

if we did think
his contemplation were above the earth
and fix on spiritual object he should still
dwell in his musings but i am afraid
his thinkings are below the moon not worth
his serious considering
king henry viii takes his seat whispers lovell who goes to cardinal wolsey


cardinal wolsey

heaven forgive me
ever god bless your highness


king henry viii

good my lord
you are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory
of your best graces in your mind the which
you were now running oer you have scarce time
to steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
to keep your earthly audit sure in that
i deem you an ill husband and am glad
to have you therein my companion


cardinal wolsey

sir
for holy offices i have a time a time
to think upon the part of business which
i bear i the state and nature does require
her times of preservation which perforce
i her frail son amongst my brethren mortal
must give my tendence to


king henry viii

you have said well


cardinal wolsey

and ever may your highness yoke together
as i will lend you cause my doing well
with my well saying


king henry viii

his word upon you since i had my office
i have kept you next my heart have not alone
employ you where high profits might come home
but pared my present havings to bestow
my bounties upon you


cardinal wolsey

if what i now pronounce you have found true
and if you may confess it say withal
if you are bound to us or no what say you


cardinal wolsey

my sovereign i confess your royal graces
shower on me daily have been more than could
my studied purposes requite which went
beyond all man endeavours my endeavours
have ever come too short of my desires
yet filed with my abilities mine own ends
have been mine so that evermore they pointed
to the good of your most sacred person and
the profit of the state for your great graces
heap upon me poor undeserver i
can nothing render but allegiant thanks
my prayers to heaven for you my loyalty
which ever has and ever shall be growing
till death that winter kill it


king henry viii

fairly answer
a loyal and obedient subject is
therein illustrated the honour of it
does pay the act of it as i the contrary
the foulness is the punishment i presume
that as my hand has open bounty to you
my heart dropp love my power rain honour more
on you than any so your hand and heart
your brain and every function of your power
should notwithstanding that your bond of duty
as twere in love particular be more
to me your friend than any


cardinal wolsey

i do profess
that for your highness good i ever labour
more than mine own that am have and will be 
though all the world should crack their duty to you
and throw it from their soul though perils did
abound as thick as thought could make em and
appear in forms more horrid yet my duty
as doth a rock against the chiding flood
should the approach of this wild river break
and stand unshaken yours


king henry viii

tis nobly spoken
take notice lords he has a loyal breast
for you have seen him opent read oer this
giving him papers
and after this and then to breakfast with
what appetite you have
exit king henry viii frowning upon cardinal wolsey the nobles throng after him smiling and whispering


cardinal wolsey

what should this mean
what sudden anger this how have i reap it
he parted frowning from me as if ruin
leap from his eyes so looks the chafed lion
upon the daring huntsman that has gall him
then makes him nothing i must read this paper
i fear the story of his anger tis so
this paper has undone me tis the account
of all that world of wealth i have drawn together
for mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom
and fee my friends in rome o negligence
fit for a fool to fall by what cross devil
made me put this main secret in the packet
i sent the king is there no way to cure this
no new device to beat this from his brains
i know twill stir him strongly yet i know
a way if it take right in spite of fortune
will bring me off again what this to the pope
the letter as i live with all the business
i writ to holiness nay then farewell
i have touch the highest point of all my greatness
and from that full meridian of my glory
i haste now to my setting i shall fall
like a bright exhalation m the evening
and no man see me more
re-enter to cardinal wolsey norfolk and suffolk surrey and the chamberlain


norfolk

hear the king pleasure cardinal who commands you
to render up the great seal presently
into our hands and to confine yourself
to asher house my lord of winchester
till you hear further from his highness


cardinal wolsey

stay
where your commission lords words cannot carry
authority so weighty


suffolk

who dare cross em
bearing the king will from his mouth expressly


cardinal wolsey

till i find more than will or words to do it
i mean your malice know officious lords
i dare and must deny it now i feel
of what coarse metal ye are moulded envy
how eagerly ye follow my disgraces
as if it fed ye and how sleek and wanton
ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin
follow your envious courses men of malice
you have christian warrant for em and no doubt
in time will find their fit rewards that seal
you ask with such a violence the king
mine and your master with his own hand gave me
bade me enjoy it with the place and honours
during my life and to confirm his goodness
tied it by letters-patents now wholl take it


surrey

the king that gave it


cardinal wolsey

it must be himself then


surrey

thou art a proud traitor priest


cardinal wolsey

proud lord thou liest
within these forty hours surrey durst better
have burnt that tongue than said so


surrey

thy ambition
thou scarlet sin robb this bewailing land
of noble buckingham my father-in-law
the heads of all thy brother cardinals
with thee and all thy best parts bound together
weigh not a hair of his plague of your policy
you sent me deputy for ireland
far from his succor from the king from all
that might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him
whilst your great goodness out of holy pity
absolved him with an axe


cardinal wolsey

this and all else
this talking lord can lay upon my credit
i answer is most false the duke by law
found his deserts how innocent i was
from any private malice in his end
his noble jury and foul cause can witness
if i loved many words lord i should tell you
you have as little honesty as honour
that in the way of loyalty and truth
toward the king my ever royal master
dare mate a sounder man than surrey can be
and all that love his follies


surrey

by my soul
your long coat priest protects you thou
shouldst feel
my sword i the life-blood of thee else my lords
can ye endure to hear this arrogance
and from this fellow if we live thus tamely
to be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet
farewell nobility let his grace go forward
and dare us with his cap like larks


cardinal wolsey

all goodness
is poison to thy stomach


surrey

yes that goodness
of gleaning all the land wealth into one
into your own hands cardinal by extortion
the goodness of your intercepted packets
you writ to the pope against the king your goodness
since you provoke me shall be most notorious
my lord of norfolk as you are truly noble
as you respect the common good the state
of our despised nobility our issues
who if he live will scarce be gentlemen
produce the grand sum of his sins the articles
collected from his life ill startle you
worse than the scaring bell when the brown wench
lay kissing in your arms lord cardinal


cardinal wolsey

how much methinks i could despise this man
but that i am bound in charity against it


norfolk

those articles my lord are in the king hand
but thus much they are foul ones


cardinal wolsey

so much fairer
and spotless shall mine innocence arise
when the king knows my truth


surrey

this cannot save you
i thank my memory i yet remember
some of these articles and out they shall
now if you can blush and cry guilty cardinal
youll show a little honesty


cardinal wolsey

speak on sir
i dare your worst objections if i blush
it is to see a nobleman want manners


surrey

i had rather want those than my head have at you
first that without the king assent or knowledge
you wrought to be a legate by which power
you maim the jurisdiction of all bishops


norfolk

then that in all you writ to rome or else
to foreign princes ego et rex meus
was still inscribed in which you brought the king
to be your servant


suffolk

then that without the knowledge
either of king or council when you went
ambassador to the emperor you made bold
to carry into flanders the great seal


surrey

item you sent a large commission
to gregory de cassado to conclude
without the king will or the state allowance
a league between his highness and ferrara


suffolk

that out of mere ambition you have caused
your holy hat to be stamp on the king coin


surrey

then that you have sent innumerable substance 
by what means got i leave to your own conscience 
to furnish rome and to prepare the ways
you have for dignities to the mere undoing
of all the kingdom many more there are
which since they are of you and odious
i will not taint my mouth with


chamberlain

o my lord
press not a falling man too far tis virtue
his faults lie open to the laws let them
not you correct him my heart weeps to see him
so little of his great self


surrey

i forgive him


suffolk

lord cardinal the king further pleasure is
because all those things you have done of late
by your power legatine within this kingdom
fall into the compass of a praemunire
that therefore such a writ be sued against you
to forfeit all your goods lands tenements
chattels and whatsoever and to be
out of the king protection this is my charge


norfolk

and so well leave you to your meditations
how to live better for your stubborn answer
about the giving back the great seal to us
the king shall know it and no doubt shall thank you
so fare you well my little good lord cardinal
exeunt all but cardinal wolsey


cardinal wolsey

so farewell to the little good you bear me
farewell a long farewell to all my greatness
this is the state of man to-day he puts forth
the tender leaves of hopes to-morrow blossoms
and bears his blushing honours thick upon him
the third day comes a frost a killing frost
and when he thinks good easy man full surely
his greatness is a-ripening nips his root
and then he falls as i do i have ventured
like little wanton boys that swim on bladders
this many summers in a sea of glory
but far beyond my depth my high-blown pride
at length broke under me and now has left me
weary and old with service to the mercy
of a rude stream that must for ever hide me
vain pomp and glory of this world i hate ye
i feel my heart new open o how wretched
is that poor man that hangs on princes favours
there is betwixt that smile we would aspire to
that sweet aspect of princes and their ruin
more pangs and fears than wars or women have
and when he falls he falls like lucifer
never to hope again
enter cromwell and stands amazed
why how now cromwell


cromwell

i have no power to speak sir


cardinal wolsey

what amazed
at my misfortunes can thy spirit wonder
a great man should decline nay an you weep
i am falln indeed


cromwell

how does your grace


cardinal wolsey

why well
never so truly happy my good cromwell
i know myself now and i feel within me
a peace above all earthly dignities
a still and quiet conscience the king has cured me
i humbly thank his grace and from these shoulders
these ruin pillars out of pity taken
a load would sink a navy too much honour
o tis a burthen cromwell tis a burthen
too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven


cromwell

i am glad your grace has made that right use of it


cardinal wolsey

i hope i have i am able now methinks
out of a fortitude of soul i feel
to endure more miseries and greater far
than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer
what news abroad


cromwell

the heaviest and the worst
is your displeasure with the king


cardinal wolsey

god bless him


cromwell

the next is that sir thomas more is chosen
lord chancellor in your place


cardinal wolsey

that somewhat sudden
but he a learned man may he continue
long in his highness favour and do justice
for truth sake and his conscience that his bones
when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings
may have a tomb of orphans tears wept on em what more


cromwell

that cranmer is return with welcome
install lord archbishop of canterbury


cardinal wolsey

that news indeed


cromwell

last that the lady anne
whom the king hath in secrecy long married
this day was view in open as his queen
going to chapel and the voice is now
only about her coronation


cardinal wolsey

there was the weight that pull me down o cromwell
the king has gone beyond me all my glories
in that one woman i have lost for ever
no sun shall ever usher forth mine honours
or gild again the noble troops that waited
upon my smiles go get thee from me cromwell
i am a poor falln man unworthy now
to be thy lord and master seek the king
that sun i pray may never set i have told him
what and how true thou art he will advance thee
some little memory of me will stir him 
i know his noble nature not to let
thy hopeful service perish too good cromwell
neglect him not make use now and provide
for thine own future safety


cromwell

o my lord
must i then leave you must i needs forego
so good so noble and so true a master
bear witness all that have not hearts of iron
with what a sorrow cromwell leaves his lord
the king shall have my service but my prayers
for ever and for ever shall be yours


cardinal wolsey

cromwell i did not think to shed a tear
in all my miseries but thou hast forced me
out of thy honest truth to play the woman
let dry our eyes and thus far hear me cromwell
and when i am forgotten as i shall be
and sleep in dull cold marble where no mention
of me more must be heard of say i taught thee
say wolsey that once trod the ways of glory
and sounded all the depths and shoals of honour
found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in
a sure and safe one though thy master miss it
mark but my fall and that that ruin me
cromwell i charge thee fling away ambition
by that sin fell the angels how can man then
the image of his maker hope to win by it
love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee
corruption wins not more than honesty
still in thy right hand carry gentle peace
to silence envious tongues be just and fear not
let all the ends thou aim at be thy country
thy god and truth then if thou fall
o cromwell
thou fall a blessed martyr serve the king
and prithee lead me in
there take an inventory of all i have
to the last penny tis the king my robe
and my integrity to heaven is all
i dare now call mine own o cromwell cromwell
had i but served my god with half the zeal
i served my king he would not in mine age
have left me naked to mine enemies


cromwell

good sir have patience


cardinal wolsey

so i have farewell
the hopes of court my hopes in heaven do dwell

side her the bishops of london and
winchester
 the old duchess of norfolk in a coronal of
gold wrought with flowers bearing queen
anne train
 certain ladies or countesses with plain
circlets of gold without flowers
they pass over the stage in order and state


second gentleman

a royal train believe me these i know
who that that bears the sceptre


first gentleman

marquess dorset
and that the earl of surrey with the rod


second gentleman

a bold brave gentleman that should be
the duke of suffolk


first gentleman

tis the same high-steward


second gentleman

and that my lord of norfolk


first gentleman

yes


second gentleman

heaven bless thee
looking on queen anne
thou hast the sweetest face i ever look on
sir as i have a soul she is an angel
our king has all the indies in his arms
and more and richer when he strains that lady
i cannot blame his conscience


first gentleman

they that bear
the cloth of honour over her are four barons
of the cinque-ports


second gentleman

those men are happy and so are all are near her
i take it she that carries up the train
is that old noble lady duchess of norfolk


first gentleman

it is and all the rest are countesses


second gentleman

their coronets say so these are stars indeed
and sometimes falling ones


first gentleman

no more of that
exit procession and then a great flourish of trumpets
enter a third gentleman


first gentleman

god save you sir where have you been broiling


third gentleman

among the crowd i the abbey where a finger
could not be wedged in more i am stifled
with the mere rankness of their joy


second gentleman

you saw
the ceremony


third gentleman

that i did


first gentleman

how was it


third gentleman

well worth the seeing


second gentleman

good sir speak it to us


third gentleman

as well as i am able the rich stream
of lords and ladies having brought the queen
to a prepared place in the choir fell off
a distance from her while her grace sat down
to rest awhile some half an hour or so
in a rich chair of state opposing freely
the beauty of her person to the people
believe me sir she is the goodliest woman
that ever lay by man which when the people
had the full view of such a noise arose
as the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest
as loud and to as many tunes hats cloaks 
doublets i think flew up and had their faces
been loose this day they had been lost such joy
i never saw before great-bellied women
that had not half a week to go like rams
in the old time of war would shake the press
and make em reel before em no man living
could say this is my wife there all were woven
so strangely in one piece


second gentleman

but what follow


third gentleman

at length her grace rose and with modest paces
came to the altar where she kneel and saint-like
cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray devoutly
then rose again and bow her to the people
when by the archbishop of canterbury
she had all the royal makings of a queen
as holy oil edward confessor crown
the rod and bird of peace and all such emblems
laid nobly on her which perform the choir
with all the choicest music of the kingdom
together sung te deum so she parted
and with the same full state paced back again
to york-place where the feast is held


first gentleman

sir
you must no more call it york-place that past
for since the cardinal fell that title lost
tis now the king and call whitehall


third gentleman

i know it
but tis so lately alter that the old name
is fresh about me


second gentleman

what two reverend bishops
were those that went on each side of the queen


third gentleman

stokesly and gardiner the one of winchester
newly preferr from the king secretary
the other london


second gentleman

he of winchester
is held no great good lover of the archbishop
the virtuous cranmer


third gentleman

all the land knows that
however yet there is no great breach when it comes
cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him


second gentleman

who may that be i pray you


third gentleman

thomas cromwell
a man in much esteem with the king and truly
a worthy friend the king has made him master
o the jewel house
and one already of the privy council


second gentleman

he will deserve more


third gentleman

yes without all doubt
come gentlemen ye shall go my way which
is to the court and there ye shall be my guests
something i can command as i walk thither
ill tell ye more


both

you may command us sir

scene ii kimbolton

enter katharine dowager sick led between griffith her gentleman usher and patience her woman


griffith

how does your grace


katharine

o griffith sick to death
my legs like loaden branches bow to the earth
willing to leave their burthen reach a chair
so now methinks i feel a little ease
didst thou not tell me griffith as thou led me
that the great child of honour cardinal wolsey was dead


griffith

yes madam but i think your grace
out of the pain you suffer gave no ear tot


katharine

prithee good griffith tell me how he died
if well he stepp before me happily
for my example


griffith

well the voice goes madam
for after the stout earl northumberland
arrested him at york and brought him forward
as a man sorely tainted to his answer
he fell sick suddenly and grew so ill
he could not sit his mule


katharine

alas poor man


griffith

at last with easy roads he came to leicester
lodged in the abbey where the reverend abbot
with all his covent honourably received him
to whom he gave these words o father abbot
an old man broken with the storms of state
is come to lay his weary bones among ye
give him a little earth for charity
so went to bed where eagerly his sickness
pursued him still and three nights after this
about the hour of eight which he himself
foretold should be his last full of repentance
continual meditations tears and sorrows
he gave his honours to the world again
his blessed part to heaven and slept in peace


katharine

so may he rest his faults lie gently on him
yet thus far griffith give me leave to speak him
and yet with charity he was a man
of an unbounded stomach ever ranking
himself with princes one that by suggestion
tied all the kingdom simony was fair-play
his own opinion was his law i the presence
he would say untruths and be ever double
both in his words and meaning he was never
but where he meant to ruin pitiful
his promises were as he then was mighty
but his performance as he is now nothing
of his own body he was ill and gave
the clergy in example


griffith

noble madam
men evil manners live in brass their virtues
we write in water may it please your highness
to hear me speak his good now


katharine

yes good griffith
i were malicious else


griffith

this cardinal
though from an humble stock undoubtedly
was fashion to much honour from his cradle
he was a scholar and a ripe and good one
exceeding wise fair-spoken and persuading
lofty and sour to them that loved him not
but to those men that sought him sweet as summer
and though he were unsatisfied in getting
which was a sin yet in bestowing madam
he was most princely ever witness for him
those twins of learning that he raised in you
ipswich and oxford one of which fell with him
unwilling to outlive the good that did it
the other though unfinish yet so famous
so excellent in art and still so rising
that christendom shall ever speak his virtue
his overthrow heap happiness upon him
for then and not till then he felt himself
and found the blessedness of being little
and to add greater honours to his age
than man could give him he died fearing god


katharine

after my death i wish no other herald
no other speaker of my living actions
to keep mine honour from corruption
but such an honest chronicler as griffith
whom i most hated living thou hast made me
with thy religious truth and modesty
now in his ashes honour peace be with him
patience be near me still and set me lower
i have not long to trouble thee good griffith
cause the musicians play me that sad note
i named my knell whilst i sit meditating
on that celestial harmony i go to
sad and solemn music


griffith

she is asleep good wench let sit down quiet
for fear we wake her softly gentle patience
the vision enter solemnly tripping one after  another six personages clad in white robes  wearing on their heads garlands of bays and golden  vizards on their faces branches of bays or palm in  their hands they first congee unto her then  dance and at certain changes the first two hold  a spare garland over her head at which the other  four make reverent curtsies then the two that held  the garland deliver the same to the other next two  who observe the same order in their changes and  holding the garland over her head which done  they deliver the same garland to the last two who  likewise observe the same order at which as it  were by inspiration she makes in her sleep signs  of rejoicing and holdeth up her hands to heaven  and so in their dancing vanish carrying the garland with them the music continues


katharine

spirits of peace where are ye are ye all gone
and leave me here in wretchedness behind ye


griffith

madam we are here


katharine

it is not you i call for
saw ye none enter since i slept


griffith

none madam


katharine

no saw you not even now a blessed troop
invite me to a banquet whose bright faces
cast thousand beams upon me like the sun
they promised me eternal happiness
and brought me garlands griffith which i feel
i am not worthy yet to wear i shall assuredly


griffith

i am most joyful madam such good dreams
possess your fancy


katharine

bid the music leave
they are harsh and heavy to me
music ceases


patience

do you note
how much her grace is alter on the sudden
how long her face is drawn how pale she looks
and of an earthy cold mark her eyes


griffith

she is going wench pray pray


patience

heaven comfort her
enter a messenger


messenger

ant like your grace 


katharine

you are a saucy fellow
deserve we no more reverence


griffith

you are to blame
knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness
to use so rude behavior go to kneel


messenger

i humbly do entreat your highness pardon
my haste made me unmannerly there is staying
a gentleman sent from the king to see you


katharine

admit him entrance griffith but this fellow
let me neer see again
exeunt griffith and messenger
re-enter griffith with capucius

the king request that i would visit you
who grieves much for your weakness and by me
sends you his princely commendations
and heartily entreats you take good comfort


katharine

o my good lord that comfort comes too late
tis like a pardon after execution
that gentle physic given in time had cured me
but now i am past an comforts here but prayers
how does his highness


capucius

madam in good health


katharine

so may he ever do and ever flourish
when i shal l dwell with worms and my poor name
banish the kingdom patience is that letter
i caused you write yet sent away


patience

giving it to katharine


katharine

sir i most humbly pray you to deliver
this to my lord the king


capucius

most willing madam


katharine

in which i have commended to his goodness
the model of our chaste loves his young daughter
the dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her
beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding 
she is young and of a noble modest nature
i hope she will deserve well and a little
to love her for her mother sake that loved him
heaven knows how dearly my next poor petition
is that his noble grace would have some pity
upon my wretched women that so long
have follow both my fortunes faithfully
of which there is not one i dare avow
and now i should not lie but will deserve
for virtue and true beauty of the soul
for honesty and decent carriage
a right good husband let him be a noble
and sure those men are happy that shall have em
the last is for my men they are the poorest
but poverty could never draw em from me
that they may have their wages duly paid em
and something over to remember me by
if heaven had pleased to have given me longer life
and able means we had not parted thus
these are the whole contents and good my lord
by that you love the dearest in this world
as you wish christian peace to souls departed
stand these poor people friend and urge the king
to do me this last right


capucius

by heaven i will
or let me lose the fashion of a man


katharine

i thank you honest lord remember me
in all humility unto his highness
say his long trouble now is passing
out of this world tell him in death i bless him
for so i will mine eyes grow dim farewell
my lord griffith farewell nay patience
you must not leave me yet i must to bed
call in more women when i am dead good wench
let me be used with honour strew me over
with maiden flowers that all the world may know
i was a chaste wife to my grave embalm me
then lay me forth although unqueen yet like
a queen and daughter to a king inter me

scene iii the council-chamber

enter chancellor places himself at the upper end  of the table on the left hand a seat being left  void above him as for cranmer seat suffolk  norfolk surrey chamberlain gardiner seat  themselves in order on each side cromwell at lower end as secretary keeper at the door


chancellor

why are we met in council


cromwell

the chief cause concerns his grace of canterbury


gardiner

norfolk

keeper

without my noble lords


gardiner

yes


keeper

my lord archbishop
and has done half an hour to know your pleasures


chancellor

let him come in


keeper

your grace may enter now
cranmer enters and approaches the council-table


chancellor

my good lord archbishop im very sorry
to sit here at this present and behold
that chair stand empty but we all are men
in our own natures frail and capable
of our flesh few are angels out of which frailty
and want of wisdom you that best should teach us
have misdemean yourself and not a little
toward the king first then his laws in filling
the whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains
for so we are inform with new opinions
divers and dangerous which are heresies
and not reform may prove pernicious


gardiner

which reformation must be sudden too
my noble lords for those that tame wild horses
pace em not in their hands to make em gentle
but stop their mouths with stubborn bits and spur em
till they obey the manage if we suffer
out of our easiness and childish pity
to one man honour this contagious sickness
farewell all physic and what follows then
commotions uproars with a general taint
of the whole state as of late days our neighbours
the upper germany can dearly witness
yet freshly pitied in our memories


cranmer

my good lords hitherto in all the progress
both of my life and office i have labour
and with no little study that my teaching
and the strong course of my authority
might go one way and safely and the end
was ever to do well nor is there living
i speak it with a single heart my lords
a man that more detests more stirs against
both in his private conscience and his place
defacers of a public peace than i do
pray heaven the king may never find a heart
with less allegiance in it men that make
envy and crooked malice nourishment
dare bite the best i do beseech your lordships
that in this case of justice my accusers
be what they will may stand forth face to face
and freely urge against me


suffolk

nay my lord
that cannot be you are a counsellor
and by that virtue no man dare accuse you


gardiner

my lord because we have business of more moment
we will be short with you tis his highness pleasure
and our consent for better trial of you
from hence you be committed to the tower
where being but a private man again
you shall know many dare accuse you boldly
more than i fear you are provided for


cranmer

ah my good lord of winchester i thank you
you are always my good friend if your will pass
i shall both find your lordship judge and juror
you are so merciful i see your end
tis my undoing love and meekness lord
become a churchman better than ambition
win straying souls with modesty again
cast none away that i shall clear myself
lay all the weight ye can upon my patience
i make as little doubt as you do conscience
in doing daily wrongs i could say more
but reverence to your calling makes me modest


gardiner

my lord my lord you are a sectary
that the plain truth your painted gloss discovers
to men that understand you words and weakness


cromwell

my lord of winchester you are a little
by your good favour too sharp men so noble
however faulty yet should find respect
for what they have been tis a cruelty
to load a falling man


gardiner

good master secretary
i cry your honour mercy you may worst
of all this table say so


cromwell

why my lord


gardiner

do not i know you for a favourer
of this new sect ye are not sound


cromwell

not sound


gardiner

not sound i say


cromwell

would you were half so honest
men prayers then would seek you not their fears


gardiner

i shall remember this bold language


cromwell

do
remember your bold life too


chancellor

this is too much
forbear for shame my lords


gardiner

i have done


cromwell

and i


chancellor

then thus for you my lord it stands agreed
i take it by all voices that forthwith
you be convey to the tower a prisoner
there to remain till the king further pleasure
be known unto us are you all agreed lords


all

we are


cranmer

is there no other way of mercy
but i must needs to the tower my lords


gardiner

what other
would you expect you are strangely troublesome
let some o the guard be ready there
enter guard


cranmer

for me
must i go like a traitor thither


gardiner

receive him
and see him safe i the tower


cranmer

stay good my lords
i have a little yet to say look there my lords
by virtue of that ring i take my cause
out of the gripes of cruel men and give it
to a most noble judge the king my master


chamberlain

this is the king ring


surrey

tis no counterfeit


suffolk

tis the right ring by heaven i told ye all
when ye first put this dangerous stone a-rolling
twould fall upon ourselves


norfolk

do you think my lords
the king will suffer but the little finger
of this man to be vex


chancellor

tis now too certain
how much more is his life in value with him
would i were fairly out ont


cromwell

my mind gave me
in seeking tales and informations
against this man whose honesty the devil
and his disciples only envy at
ye blew the fire that burns ye now have at ye
enter king frowning on them takes his seat


gardiner

dread sovereign how much are we bound to heaven
in daily thanks that gave us such a prince
not only good and wise but most religious
one that in all obedience makes the church
the chief aim of his honour and to strengthen
that holy duty out of dear respect
his royal self in judgment comes to hear
the cause betwixt her and this great offender


king henry viii

you were ever good at sudden commendations
bishop of winchester but know i come not
to hear such flattery now and in my presence
they are too thin and bare to hide offences
to me you cannot reach you play the spaniel
and think with wagging of your tongue to win me
but whatsoeer thou takest me for im sure
thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody
to cranmer
good man sit down now let me see the proudest
he that dares most but wag his finger at thee
by all that holy he had better starve
than but once think this place becomes thee not


surrey

may it please your grace 


king henry viii

no sir it does not please me
i had thought i had had men of some understanding
and wisdom of my council but i find none
was it discretion lords to let this man
this good man few of you deserve that title 
this honest man wait like a lousy footboy
at chamber door and one as great as you are
why what a shame was this did my commission
bid ye so far forget yourselves i gave ye
power as he was a counsellor to try him
not as a groom there some of ye i see
more out of malice than integrity
would try him to the utmost had ye mean
which ye shall never have while i live


chancellor

wit near him that railed upon me till her pinked
porringer fell off her head for kindling such a
combustion in the state i missed the meteor once
and hit that woman who cried out clubs when i
might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to
her succor which were the hope o the strand where
she was quartered they fell on i made good my
place at length they came to the broom-staff to

boys behind em loose shot delivered such a shower
of pebbles that i was fain to draw mine honour in
and let em win the work the devil was amongst

and fight for bitten apples that no audience but

but few now living can behold that goodness 
a pattern to all princes living with her
and all that shall succeed saba was never
more covetous of wisdom and fair virtue

that mould up such a mighty piece as this is
with all the virtues that attend the good

holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her
she shall be loved and fear her own shall bless her
her foes shake like a field of beaten corn
and hang their heads with sorrow good grows with her
in her days every man shall eat in safety
under his own vine what he plants and sing
the merry songs of peace to all his neighbours
god shall be truly known and those about her
from her shall read the perfect ways of honour
and by those claim their greatness not by blood
nor shall this peace sleep with her but as when
the bird of wonder dies the maiden phoenix
her ashes new create another heir
as great in admiration as herself
so shall she leave her blessedness to one
when heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness
who from the sacred ashes of her honour
shall star-like rise as great in fame as she was
and so stand fix peace plenty love truth terror
that were the servants to this chosen infant
shall then be his and like a vine grow to him
wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine
his honour and the greatness of his name
shall be and make new nations he shall flourish
and like a mountain cedar reach his branches
to all the plains about him our children children
shall see this and bless heaven


king henry viii

thou speakest wonders


cranmer

she shall be to the happiness of england
an aged princess many days shall see her
and yet no day without a deed to crown it
would i had known no more but she must die
she must the saints must have her yet a virgin
a most unspotted lily shall she pass
to the ground and all the world shall mourn her


king henry viii

o lord archbishop
thou hast made me now a man never before
this happy child did i get any thing
this oracle of comfort has so pleased me
that when i am in heaven i shall desire
to see what this child does and praise my maker
i thank ye all to you my good lord mayor
and your good brethren i am much beholding
i have received much honour by your presence
and ye shall find me thankful lead the way lords
ye must all see the queen and she must thank ye
she will be sick else this day no man think

theyll say tis naught others to hear the city
abused extremely and to cry that witty
which we have not done neither that i fear
all the expected good were like to hear
for this play at this time is only in
the merciful construction of good women
for such a one we show em if they smile

the life and death of king john

act i
scene i king john palace

enter king john queen elinor pembroke essex salisbury and others with chatillon


king john

now say chatillon what would france with us


chatillon

thus after greeting speaks the king of france
in my behavior to the majesty
the borrow majesty of england here


queen elinor

a strange beginning borrow majesty


king john

silence good mother hear the embassy


chatillon

philip of france in right and true behalf
of thy deceased brother geffrey son
arthur plantagenet lays most lawful claim
to this fair island and the territories
to ireland poictiers anjou touraine maine
desiring thee to lay aside the sword
which sways usurpingly these several titles
and put these same into young arthur hand
thy nephew and right royal sovereign


king john

what follows if we disallow of this


chatillon

the proud control of fierce and bloody war
to enforce these rights so forcibly withheld


king john

here have we war for war and blood for blood
controlment for controlment so answer france


chatillon

then take my king defiance from my mouth
the farthest limit of my embassy


king john

bear mine to him and so depart in peace
be thou as lightning in the eyes of france
for ere thou canst report i will be there
the thunder of my cannon shall be heard
so hence be thou the trumpet of our wrath
and sullen presage of your own decay
an honourable conduct let him have
pembroke look to t farewell chatillon
exeunt chatillon and pembroke


queen elinor

what now my son have i not ever said
how that ambitious constance would not cease
till she had kindled france and all the world
upon the right and party of her son
this might have been prevented and made whole
with very easy arguments of love
which now the manage of two kingdoms must
with fearful bloody issue arbitrate


king john

our strong possession and our right for us


queen elinor

your strong possession much more than your right
or else it must go wrong with you and me
so much my conscience whispers in your ear
which none but heaven and you and i shall hear
enter a sheriff


essex

my liege here is the strangest controversy
come from country to be judged by you
that eer i heard shall i produce the men


king john

let them approach
our abbeys and our priories shall pay
this expedition charge
enter robert and the bastard
what men are you


bastard

your faithful subject i a gentleman
born in northamptonshire and eldest son
as i suppose to robert faulconbridge
a soldier by the honour-giving hand
of coeur-de-lion knighted in the field


king john

what art thou


robert

the son and heir to that same faulconbridge


king john

is that the elder and art thou the heir
you came not of one mother then it seems


bastard

most certain of one mother mighty king
that is well known and as i think one father
but for the certain knowledge of that truth
i put you oer to heaven and to my mother
of that i doubt as all men children may


queen elinor

out on thee rude man thou dost shame thy mother
and wound her honour with this diffidence


bastard

i madam no i have no reason for it
that is my brother plea and none of mine
the which if he can prove a pops me out
at least from fair five hundred pound a year
heaven guard my mother honour and my land


king john

a good blunt fellow why being younger born
doth he lay claim to thine inheritance


bastard

i know not why except to get the land
but once he slander me with bastardy
but whether i be as true begot or no
that still i lay upon my mother head
but that i am as well begot my liege 
fair fall the bones that took the pains for me 
compare our faces and be judge yourself
if old sir robert did beget us both
and were our father and this son like him
o old sir robert father on my knee
i give heaven thanks i was not like to thee


king john

why what a madcap hath heaven lent us here


queen elinor

he hath a trick of coeur-de-lion face
the accent of his tongue affecteth him
do you not read some tokens of my son
in the large composition of this man


king john

mine eye hath well examined his parts
and finds them perfect richard sirrah speak
what doth move you to claim your brother land


bastard

because he hath a half-face like my father
with half that face would he have all my land
a half-faced groat five hundred pound a year


robert

my gracious liege when that my father lived
your brother did employ my father much 


bastard

well sir by this you cannot get my land
your tale must be how he employ my mother


robert

and once dispatch him in an embassy
to germany there with the emperor
to treat of high affairs touching that time
the advantage of his absence took the king
and in the mean time sojourn at my father
where how he did prevail i shame to speak
but truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores
between my father and my mother lay
as i have heard my father speak himself
when this same lusty gentleman was got
upon his death-bed he by will bequeath
his lands to me and took it on his death
that this my mother son was none of his
and if he were he came into the world
full fourteen weeks before the course of time
then good my liege let me have what is mine
my father land as was my father will


king john

sirrah your brother is legitimate
your father wife did after wedlock bear him
and if she did play false the fault was hers
which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
that marry wives tell me how if my brother
who as you say took pains to get this son
had of your father claim this son for his
in sooth good friend your father might have kept
this calf bred from his cow from all the world
in sooth he might then if he were my brother
my brother might not claim him nor your father
being none of his refuse him this concludes
my mother son did get your father heir
your father heir must have your father land


robert

shall then my father will be of no force
to dispossess that child which is not his


bastard

of no more force to dispossess me sir
than was his will to get me as i think


queen elinor

whether hadst thou rather be a faulconbridge
and like thy brother to enjoy thy land
or the reputed son of coeur-de-lion
lord of thy presence and no land beside


bastard

madam an if my brother had my shape
and i had his sir robert his like him
and if my legs were two such riding-rods
my arms such eel-skins stuff my face so thin
that in mine ear i durst not stick a rose
lest men should say look where three-farthings goes
and to his shape were heir to all this land
would i might never stir from off this place
i would give it every foot to have this face
i would not be sir nob in any case


queen elinor

i like thee well wilt thou forsake thy fortune
bequeath thy land to him and follow me
i am a soldier and now bound to france


bastard

brother take you my land ill take my chance
your face hath got five hundred pound a year
yet sell your face for five pence and tis dear
madam ill follow you unto the death


queen elinor

nay i would have you go before me thither


bastard

our country manners give our betters way


king john

what is thy name


bastard

philip my liege so is my name begun
philip good old sir robert wife eldest son


king john

kneel thou down philip but rise more great
arise sir richard and plantagenet


bastard

my father gave me honour yours gave land
now blessed by the hour by night or day
when i was got sir robert was away


queen elinor

i am thy grandam richard call me so


bastard

madam by chance but not by truth what though
something about a little from the right
in at the window or else oer the hatch
who dares not stir by day must walk by night
and have is have however men do catch
near or far off well won is still well shot
and i am i howeer i was begot


king john

go faulconbridge now hast thou thy desire
a landless knight makes thee a landed squire
come madam and come richard we must speed
for france for france for it is more than need


bastard

brother adieu good fortune come to thee
for thou wast got i the way of honesty
exeunt all but bastard
a foot of honour better than i was
but many a many foot of land the worse
well now can i make any joan a lady
good den sir richard god-a-mercy fellow 
and if his name be george ill call him peter
for new-made honour doth forget men names
tis too respective and too sociable
for your conversion now your traveller
he and his toothpick at my worship mess
and when my knightly stomach is sufficed
why then i suck my teeth and catechise
my picked man of countries my dear sir
thus leaning on mine elbow i begin
i shall beseech you that is question now
and then comes answer like an absey book
o sir says answer at your best command
at your employment at your service sir
no sir says question i sweet sir at yours
and so ere answer knows what question would
saving in dialogue of compliment
and talking of the alps and apennines
the pyrenean and the river po
it draws toward supper in conclusion so
but this is worshipful society
and fits the mounting spirit like myself
for he is but a bastard to the time
that doth not smack of observation
and so am i whether i smack or no
and not alone in habit and device
exterior form outward accoutrement
but from the inward motion to deliver
sweet sweet sweet poison for the age tooth
which though i will not practise to deceive
yet to avoid deceit i mean to learn
for it shall strew the footsteps of my rising
but who comes in such haste in riding-robes
what woman-post is this hath she no husband
that will take pains to blow a horn before her
enter lady faulconbridge and gurney
o me it is my mother how now good lady
what brings you here to court so hastily


lady faulconbridge

where is that slave thy brother where is he
that holds in chase mine honour up and down

to whom am i beholding for these limbs
sir robert never holp to make this leg


lady faulconbridge

that for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour

bastard

but mother i am not sir robert son

legitimation name and all is gone

lady faulconbridge

bastard

lady faulconbridge

king richard coeur-de-lion was thy father
by long and vehement suit i was seduced
to make room for him in my husband bed
heaven lay not my transgression to my charge
thou art the issue of my dear offence
which was so strongly urged past my defence


bastard

now by this light were i to get again
madam i would not wish a better father
some sins do bear their privilege on earth
and so doth yours your fault was not your folly
needs must you lay your heart at his dispose
subjected tribute to commanding love
against whose fury and unmatched force
the aweless lion could not wage the fight
nor keep his princely heart from richard hand
he that perforce robs lions of their hearts
may easily win a woman ay my mother
with all my heart i thank thee for my father
who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
when i was got ill send his soul to hell

who says it was he lies i say twas not

and to rebuke the usurpation
of thy unnatural uncle english john

shadowing their right under your wings of war
i give you welcome with a powerless hand
but with a heart full of unstained love
welcome before the gates of angiers duke


lewis

a noble boy who would not do thee right


austria

upon thy cheek lay i this zealous kiss
as seal to this indenture of my love
that to my home i will no more return
till angiers and the right thou hast in france
together with that pale that white-faced shore
whose foot spurns back the ocean roaring tides
and coops from other lands her islanders
even till that england hedged in with the main
that water-walled bulwark still secure
and confident from foreign purposes
even till that utmost corner of the west
salute thee for her king till then fair boy
will i not think of home but follow arms


constance

o take his mother thanks a widow thanks
till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
to make a more requital to your love

well then to work our cannon shall be bent
against the brows of this resisting town
call for our chiefest men of discipline
to cull the plots of best advantages
well lay before this town our royal bones
wade to the market-place in frenchmen blood
but we will make it subject to this boy


constance

stay for an answer to your embassy
lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood
my lord chatillon may from england bring
that right in peace which here we urge in war
and then we shall repent each drop of blood
that hot rash haste so indirectly shed
enter chatillon


king philip

a wonder lady lo upon thy wish
our messenger chatillon is arrived
what england says say briefly gentle lord
we coldly pause for thee chatillon speak


chatillon

then turn your forces from this paltry siege
and stir them up against a mightier task
england impatient of your just demands
hath put himself in arms the adverse winds
whose leisure i have stay have given him time
to land his legions all as soon as i
his marches are expedient to this town
his forces strong his soldiers confident
with him along is come the mother-queen
an ate stirring him to blood and strife
with her her niece the lady blanch of spain
with them a bastard of the king deceased
and all the unsettled humours of the land
rash inconsiderate fiery voluntaries
with ladies faces and fierce dragons spleens
have sold their fortunes at their native homes
bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs
to make hazard of new fortunes here
in brief a braver choice of dauntless spirits
than now the english bottoms have waft oer
did nearer float upon the swelling tide
to do offence and scath in christendom
drum beats
the interruption of their churlish drums
cuts off more circumstance they are at hand
to parley or to fight therefore prepare

king philip

peace be to england if that war return
from france to england there to live in peace
england we love and for that england sake
with burden of our armour here we sweat
this toil of ours should be a work of thine
but thou from loving england art so far
that thou hast under-wrought his lawful king
cut off the sequence of posterity
out-faced infant state and done a rape
upon the maiden virtue of the crown
look here upon thy brother geffrey face
these eyes these brows were moulded out of his
this little abstract doth contain that large
which died in geffrey and the hand of time
shall draw this brief into as huge a volume
that geffrey was thy elder brother born
and this his son england was geffrey right
and this is geffrey in the name of god
how comes it then that thou art call a king
when living blood doth in these temples beat
which owe the crown that thou oermasterest


king john

from whom hast thou this great commission france
to draw my answer from thy articles


king philip

from that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
in any breast of strong authority
to look into the blots and stains of right
that judge hath made me guardian to this boy
under whose warrant i impeach thy wrong
and by whose help i mean to chastise it


king john

thou unadvised scold i can produce
a will that bars the title of thy son


constance

ay who doubts that a will a wicked will
a woman will a canker grandam will


king philip

peace lady pause or be more temperate
it ill beseems this presence to cry aim
to these ill-tuned repetitions
some trumpet summon hither to the walls
these men of angiers let us hear them speak
whose title they admit arthur or john
trumpet sounds enter certain citizens upon the walls


first citizen

who is it that hath warn us to the walls


king philip

tis france for england


king john

england for itself
you men of angiers and my loving subjects 


king philip

you loving men of angiers arthur subjects
our trumpet call you to this gentle parle 


king john

for our advantage therefore hear us first
these flags of france that are advanced here
before the eye and prospect of your town
have hither march to your endamagement
the cannons have their bowels full of wrath
and ready mounted are they to spit forth
their iron indignation gainst your walls
all preparation for a bloody siege
all merciless proceeding by these french
confronts your city eyes your winking gates
and but for our approach those sleeping stones
that as a waist doth girdle you about
by the compulsion of their ordinance
by this time from their fixed beds of lime
had been dishabited and wide havoc made
for bloody power to rush upon your peace
but on the sight of us your lawful king
who painfully with much expedient march
have brought a countercheque before your gates
to save unscratch your city threatened cheeks
behold the french amazed vouchsafe a parle
and now instead of bullets wrapp in fire
to make a shaking fever in your walls
they shoot but calm words folded up in smoke
to make a faithless error in your ears
which trust accordingly kind citizens
and let us in your king whose labour spirits
forwearied in this action of swift speed
crave harbourage within your city walls


king philip

when i have said make answer to us both
lo in this right hand whose protection
is most divinely vow upon the right
of him it holds stands young plantagenet
son to the elder brother of this man
and king oer him and all that he enjoys
for this down-trodden equity we tread
in warlike march these greens before your town
being no further enemy to you
than the constraint of hospitable zeal
in the relief of this oppressed child
religiously provokes be pleased then
to pay that duty which you truly owe
to that owes it namely this young prince
and then our arms like to a muzzled bear
save in aspect hath all offence seal up
our cannons malice vainly shall be spent
against the invulnerable clouds of heaven
and with a blessed and unvex retire
with unhack swords and helmets all unbruised
we will bear home that lusty blood again
which here we came to spout against your town
and leave your children wives and you in peace
but if you fondly pass our proffer offer
tis not the roundure of your old-faced walls
can hide you from our messengers of war
though all these english and their discipline
were harbour in their rude circumference
then tell us shall your city call us lord
in that behalf which we have challenged it
or shall we give the signal to our rage
and stalk in blood to our possession


first citizen

in brief we are the king of england subjects
for him and in his right we hold this town


king john

acknowledge then the king and let me in


first citizen

that can we not but he that proves the king
to him will we prove loyal till that time
have we ramm up our gates against the world


king john

doth not the crown of england prove the king
and if not that i bring you witnesses
twice fifteen thousand hearts of england breed 


bastard

bastards and else


king john

to verify our title with their lives


king philip

as many and as well-born bloods as those 


bastard

some bastards too


king philip

stand in his face to contradict his claim


first citizen

till you compound whose right is worthiest
we for the worthiest hold the right from both


king john

then god forgive the sin of all those souls
that to their everlasting residence
before the dew of evening fall shall fleet
in dreadful trial of our kingdom king


king philip

amen amen mount chevaliers to arms


bastard

saint george that swinged the dragon and eer since
sits on his horseback at mine hostess door
teach us some fence
to austria
sirrah were i at home
at your den sirrah with your lioness
i would set an ox-head to your lion hide
and make a monster of you


austria

peace no more


bastard

o tremble for you hear the lion roar


king john

up higher to the plain where well set forth
in best appointment all our regiments


bastard

speed then to take advantage of the field


king philip

it shall be so and at the other hill
command the rest to stand god and our right
exeunt
here after excursions enter the herald of france with trumpets to the gates


french herald

you men of angiers open wide your gates
and let young arthur duke of bretagne in
who by the hand of france this day hath made
much work for tears in many an english mother
whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground
many a widow husband grovelling lies
coldly embracing the discolour earth
and victory with little loss doth play
upon the dancing banners of the french
who are at hand triumphantly display
to enter conquerors and to proclaim
arthur of bretagne england king and yours
enter english herald with trumpet


english herald

rejoice you men of angiers ring your bells
king john your king and england doth approach
commander of this hot malicious day
their armours that march hence so silver-bright
hither return all gilt with frenchmen blood
there stuck no plume in any english crest
that is removed by a staff of france
our colours do return in those same hands
that did display them when we first march forth
and like a troop of jolly huntsmen come
our lusty english all with purpled hands
dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes
open your gates and gives the victors way


first citizen

heralds from off our towers we might behold
from first to last the onset and retire
of both your armies whose equality
by our best eyes cannot be censured
blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows
strength match with strength and power confronted power
both are alike and both alike we like
one must prove greatest while they weigh so even
we hold our town for neither yet for both
re-enter king john and king philip with their powers severally


king john

france hast thou yet more blood to cast away
say shall the current of our right run on
whose passage vex with thy impediment
shall leave his native channel and oerswell
with course disturb even thy confining shores
unless thou let his silver water keep
a peaceful progress to the ocean


king philip

england thou hast not saved one drop of blood
in this hot trial more than we of france
rather lost more and by this hand i swear
that sways the earth this climate overlooks
before we will lay down our just-borne arms
well put thee down gainst whom these arms we bear
or add a royal number to the dead
gracing the scroll that tells of this war loss
with slaughter coupled to the name of kings


bastard

ha majesty how high thy glory towers
when the rich blood of kings is set on fire
o now doth death line his dead chaps with steel
the swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs
and now he feasts mousing the flesh of men
in undetermined differences of kings
why stand these royal fronts amazed thus
cry havoc kings back to the stained field
you equal potents fiery kindled spirits
then let confusion of one part confirm
the other peace till then blows blood and death


king john

whose party do the townsmen yet admit


king philip

speak citizens for england who your king


first citizen

the king of england when we know the king


king philip

know him in us that here hold up his right


king john

in us that are our own great deputy
and bear possession of our person here
lord of our presence angiers and of you


first citizen

a greater power then we denies all this
and till it be undoubted we do lock
our former scruple in our strong-barr gates
king of our fears until our fears resolved
be by some certain king purged and deposed


bastard

by heaven these scroyles of angiers flout you kings
and stand securely on their battlements
as in a theatre whence they gape and point
at your industrious scenes and acts of death
your royal presences be ruled by me
do like the mutines of jerusalem
be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
your sharpest deeds of malice on this town
by east and west let france and england mount
their battering cannon charged to the mouths
till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl down
the flinty ribs of this contemptuous city
ild play incessantly upon these jades
even till unfenced desolation
leave them as naked as the vulgar air
that done dissever your united strengths
and part your mingled colours once again
turn face to face and bloody point to point
then in a moment fortune shall cull forth
out of one side her happy minion
to whom in favour she shall give the day
and kiss him with a glorious victory
how like you this wild counsel mighty states
smacks it not something of the policy


king john

now by the sky that hangs above our heads
i like it well france shall we knit our powers
and lay this angiers even to the ground
then after fight who shall be king of it


bastard

an if thou hast the mettle of a king
being wronged as we are by this peevish town
turn thou the mouth of thy artillery
as we will ours against these saucy walls
and when that we have dash them to the ground
why then defy each other and pell-mell
make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell


king philip

let it be so say where will you assault


king john

we from the west will send destruction
into this city bosom


austria

i from the north


king philip

our thunder from the south
shall rain their drift of bullets on this town


bastard

o prudent discipline from north to south
austria and france shoot in each other mouth
ill stir them to it come away away


first citizen

hear us great kings vouchsafe awhile to stay
and i shall show you peace and fair-faced league
win you this city without stroke or wound
rescue those breathing lives to die in beds
that here come sacrifices for the field
persever not but hear me mighty kings


king john

speak on with favour we are bent to hear


first citizen

that daughter there of spain the lady blanch
is niece to england look upon the years
of lewis the dauphin and that lovely maid
if lusty love should go in quest of beauty
where should he find it fairer than in blanch
if zealous love should go in search of virtue
where should he find it purer than in blanch
if love ambitious sought a match of birth
whose veins bound richer blood than lady blanch
such as she is in beauty virtue birth
is the young dauphin every way complete
if not complete of say he is not she
and she again wants nothing to name want
if want it be not that she is not he
he is the half part of a blessed man
left to be finished by such as she
and she a fair divided excellence
whose fulness of perfection lies in him
o two such silver currents when they join
do glorify the banks that bound them in
and two such shores to two such streams made one
two such controlling bounds shall you be kings
to these two princes if you marry them
this union shall do more than battery can
to our fast-closed gates for at this match
with swifter spleen than powder can enforce
the mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope
and give you entrance but without this match
the sea enraged is not half so deaf
lions more confident mountains and rocks
more free from motion no not death himself
in moral fury half so peremptory
as we to keep this city


bastard

here a stay
that shakes the rotten carcass of old death
out of his rags here a large mouth indeed
that spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas
talks as familiarly of roaring lions
as maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs
what cannoneer begot this lusty blood
he speaks plain cannon fire and smoke and bounce
he gives the bastinado with his tongue
our ears are cudgell not a word of his
but buffets better than a fist of france
zounds i was never so bethump with words
since i first call my brother father dad


queen elinor

son list to this conjunction make this match
give with our niece a dowry large enough
for by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
thy now unsured assurance to the crown
that yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
the bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit
i see a yielding in the looks of france
mark how they whisper urge them while their souls
are capable of this ambition
lest zeal now melted by the windy breath
of soft petitions pity and remorse
cool and congeal again to what it was


first citizen

why answer not the double majesties
this friendly treaty of our threaten town


king philip

speak england first that hath been forward first
to speak unto this city what say you


king john

if that the dauphin there thy princely son
can in this book of beauty read i love
her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen
for anjou and fair touraine maine poictiers
and all that we upon this side the sea
except this city now by us besieged
find liable to our crown and dignity
shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
in titles honours and promotions
as she in beauty education blood
holds hand with any princess of the world


king philip

what say thou boy look in the lady face


lewis

i do my lord and in her eye i find
a wonder or a wondrous miracle
the shadow of myself form in her eye
which being but the shadow of your son
becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow
i do protest i never loved myself
till now infixed i beheld myself
drawn in the flattering table of her eye
whispers with blanch


bastard

drawn in the flattering table of her eye
hang in the frowning wrinkle of her brow
and quarter in her heart he doth espy
himself love traitor this is pity now
that hang and drawn and quartered there should be
in such a love so vile a lout as he


blanch

my uncle will in this respect is mine
if he see aught in you that makes him like
that any thing he sees which moves his liking
i can with ease translate it to my will
or if you will to speak more properly
i will enforce it easily to my love
further i will not flatter you my lord
that all i see in you is worthy love
than this that nothing do i see in you
though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge
that i can find should merit any hate


king john

what say these young ones what say you my niece


blanch

that she is bound in honour still to do
what you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say


king john

speak then prince dauphin can you love this lady


lewis

nay ask me if i can refrain from love
for i do love her most unfeignedly


king john

then do i give volquessen touraine maine
poictiers and anjou these five provinces
with her to thee and this addition more
full thirty thousand marks of english coin
philip of france if thou be pleased withal
command thy son and daughter to join hands


king philip

it likes us well young princes close your hands


austria

and your lips too for i am well assured
that i did so when i was first assured


king philip

now citizens of angiers ope your gates
let in that amity which you have made
for at saint mary chapel presently
the rites of marriage shall be solemnized
is not the lady constance in this troop
i know she is not for this match made up
her presence would have interrupted much
where is she and her son tell me who knows


lewis

she is sad and passionate at your highness tent


king philip

and by my faith this league that we have made
will give her sadness very little cure
brother of england how may we content
this widow lady in her right we came
which we god knows have turn another way
to our own vantage


king john

we will heal up all
for well create young arthur duke of bretagne
and earl of richmond and this rich fair town
we make him lord of call the lady constance
some speedy messenger bid her repair
to our solemnity i trust we shall
if not fill up the measure of her will
yet in some measure satisfy her so
that we shall stop her exclamation
go we as well as haste will suffer us
to this unlook for unprepared pomp
exeunt all but the bastard


bastard

mad world mad kings mad composition
john to stop arthur title in the whole
hath willingly departed with a part
and france whose armour conscience buckled on
whom zeal and charity brought to the field
as god own soldier rounded in the ear
with that same purpose-changer that sly devil
that broker that still breaks the pate of faith
that daily break-vow he that wins of all
of kings of beggars old men young men maids
who having no external thing to lose
but the word maid cheats the poor maid of that
that smooth-faced gentleman tickling commodity
commodity the bias of the world
the world who of itself is peised well
made to run even upon even ground
till this advantage this vile-drawing bias
this sway of motion this commodity
makes it take head from all indifferency
from all direction purpose course intent
and this same bias this commodity
this bawd this broker this all-changing word
clapp on the outward eye of fickle france
hath drawn him from his own determined aid
from a resolved and honourable war
to a most base and vile-concluded peace
and why rail i on this commodity
but for because he hath not woo me yet
not that i have the power to clutch my hand
when his fair angels would salute my palm
but for my hand as unattempted yet
like a poor beggar raileth on the rich
well whiles i am a beggar i will rail
and say there is no sin but to be rich
and being rich my virtue then shall be
to say there is no vice but beggary
since kings break faith upon commodity
gain be my lord for i will worship thee

act iii
scene i the french king pavilion

enter constance arthur and salisbury


constance

gone to be married gone to swear a peace
false blood to false blood join gone to be friends
shall lewis have blanch and blanch those provinces
it is not so thou hast misspoke misheard
be well advised tell oer thy tale again
it cannot be thou dost but say tis so
i trust i may not trust thee for thy word
is but the vain breath of a common man
believe me i do not believe thee man
i have a king oath to the contrary
thou shalt be punish for thus frighting me
for i am sick and capable of fears
oppress with wrongs and therefore full of fears
a widow husbandless subject to fears
a woman naturally born to fears
and though thou now confess thou didst but jest
with my vex spirits i cannot take a truce
but they will quake and tremble all this day
what dost thou mean by shaking of thy head
why dost thou look so sadly on my son
what means that hand upon that breast of thine
why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum
like a proud river peering oer his bounds
be these sad signs confirmers of thy words
then speak again not all thy former tale
but this one word whether thy tale be true


salisbury

as true as i believe you think them false
that give you cause to prove my saying true


constance

o if thou teach me to believe this sorrow
teach thou this sorrow how to make me die
and let belief and life encounter so
as doth the fury of two desperate men
which in the very meeting fall and die
lewis marry blanch o boy then where art thou
france friend with england what becomes of me
fellow be gone i cannot brook thy sight
this news hath made thee a most ugly man


salisbury

what other harm have i good lady done
but spoke the harm that is by others done


constance

which harm within itself so heinous is
as it makes harmful all that speak of it


arthur

i do beseech you madam be content


constance

if thou that bid me be content wert grim
ugly and slanderous to thy mother womb
full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains
lame foolish crooked swart prodigious
patch with foul moles and eye-offending marks
i would not care i then would be content
for then i should not love thee no nor thou
become thy great birth nor deserve a crown
but thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy
nature and fortune join to make thee great
of nature gifts thou mayst with lilies boast
and with the half-blown rose but fortune o
she is corrupted changed and won from thee
she adulterates hourly with thine uncle john
and with her golden hand hath pluck on france
to tread down fair respect of sovereignty
and made his majesty the bawd to theirs
france is a bawd to fortune and king john
that strumpet fortune that usurping john
tell me thou fellow is not france forsworn
envenom him with words or get thee gone
and leave those woes alone which i alone
am bound to under-bear


salisbury

pardon me madam
i may not go without you to the kings


constance

thou mayst thou shalt i will not go with thee
i will instruct my sorrows to be proud
for grief is proud and makes his owner stoop
to me and to the state of my great grief
let kings assemble for my grief so great
that no supporter but the huge firm earth
can hold it up here i and sorrows sit
here is my throne bid kings come bow to it
seats herself on the ground
enter king john king phillip lewis blanch queen elinor the bastard austria and attendants


king philip

tis true fair daughter and this blessed day
ever in france shall be kept festival
to solemnize this day the glorious sun
stays in his course and plays the alchemist
turning with splendor of his precious eye
the meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold
the yearly course that brings this day about
shall never see it but a holiday


constance

a wicked day and not a holy day
rising
what hath this day deserved what hath it done
that it in golden letters should be set
among the high tides in the calendar
nay rather turn this day out of the week
this day of shame oppression perjury
or if it must stand still let wives with child
pray that their burthens may not fall this day
lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross
but on this day let seamen fear no wreck
no bargains break that are not this day made
this day all things begun come to ill end
yea faith itself to hollow falsehood change


king philip

by heaven lady you shall have no cause
to curse the fair proceedings of this day
have i not pawn to you my majesty


constance

you have beguiled me with a counterfeit
resembling majesty which being touch and tried
proves valueless you are forsworn forsworn
you came in arms to spill mine enemies blood
but now in arms you strengthen it with yours
the grappling vigour and rough frown of war
is cold in amity and painted peace
and our oppression hath made up this league
arm arm you heavens against these perjured kings
a widow cries be husband to me heavens
let not the hours of this ungodly day
wear out the day in peace but ere sunset
set armed discord twixt these perjured kings
hear me o hear me


austria

lady constance peace


constance

war war no peace peace is to me a war
o lymoges o austria thou dost shame
that bloody spoil thou slave thou wretch thou coward
thou little valiant great in villany
thou ever strong upon the stronger side
thou fortune champion that dost never fight
but when her humorous ladyship is by
to teach thee safety thou art perjured too
and soothest up greatness what a fool art thou
a ramping fool to brag and stamp and swear
upon my party thou cold-blooded slave
hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side
been sworn my soldier bidding me depend
upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength
and dost thou now fall over to my fores
thou wear a lion hide doff it for shame
and hang a calf-skin on those recreant limbs


austria

o that a man should speak those words to me


bastard

and hang a calf-skin on those recreant limbs


austria

thou darest not say so villain for thy life


bastard

and hang a calf-skin on those recreant limbs


king john

we like not this thou dost forget thyself
enter cardinal pandulph


king philip

here comes the holy legate of the pope


cardinal pandulph

hail you anointed deputies of heaven
to thee king john my holy errand is
i pandulph of fair milan cardinal
and from pope innocent the legate here
do in his name religiously demand
why thou against the church our holy mother
so wilfully dost spurn and force perforce
keep stephen langton chosen archbishop
of canterbury from that holy see
this in our foresaid holy father name
pope innocent i do demand of thee


king john

what earthy name to interrogatories
can task the free breath of a sacred king
thou canst not cardinal devise a name
so slight unworthy and ridiculous
to charge me to an answer as the pope
tell him this tale and from the mouth of england
add thus much more that no italian priest
shall tithe or toll in our dominions
but as we under heaven are supreme head
so under him that great supremacy
where we do reign we will alone uphold
without the assistance of a mortal hand
so tell the pope all reverence set apart
to him and his usurp authority


king philip

brother of england you blaspheme in this


king john

though you and all the kings of christendom
are led so grossly by this meddling priest
dreading the curse that money may buy out
and by the merit of vile gold dross dust
purchase corrupted pardon of a man
who in that sale sells pardon from himself
though you and all the rest so grossly led
this juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish
yet i alone alone do me oppose
against the pope and count his friends my foes


cardinal pandulph

then by the lawful power that i have
thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate
and blessed shall he be that doth revolt
from his allegiance to an heretic
and meritorious shall that hand be call
canonized and worshipped as a saint
that takes away by any secret course
thy hateful life


constance

o lawful let it be
that i have room with rome to curse awhile
good father cardinal cry thou amen
to my keen curses for without my wrong
there is no tongue hath power to curse him right


cardinal pandulph

there law and warrant lady for my curse


constance

and for mine too when law can do no right
let it be lawful that law bar no wrong
law cannot give my child his kingdom here
for he that holds his kingdom holds the law
therefore since law itself is perfect wrong
how can the law forbid my tongue to curse


cardinal pandulph

philip of france on peril of a curse
let go the hand of that arch-heretic
and raise the power of france upon his head
unless he do submit himself to rome


queen elinor

look thou pale france do not let go thy hand


constance

look to that devil lest that france repent
and by disjoining hands hell lose a soul


austria

king philip listen to the cardinal


bastard

and hang a calf-skin on his recreant limbs


austria

well ruffian i must pocket up these wrongs because 


bastard

your breeches best may carry them


king john

philip what say thou to the cardinal


constance

what should he say but as the cardinal


lewis

bethink you father for the difference
is purchase of a heavy curse from rome
or the light loss of england for a friend
forego the easier


blanch

that the curse of rome


constance

o lewis stand fast the devil tempts thee here
in likeness of a new untrimmed bride


blanch

the lady constance speaks not from her faith
but from her need


constance

o if thou grant my need
which only lives but by the death of faith
that need must needs infer this principle
that faith would live again by death of need
o then tread down my need and faith mounts up
keep my need up and faith is trodden down


king john

the king is moved and answers not to this


constance

o be removed from him and answer well


austria

do so king philip hang no more in doubt


bastard

hang nothing but a calf-skin most sweet lout


king philip

i am perplex and know not what to say


cardinal pandulph

what canst thou say but will perplex thee more
if thou stand excommunicate and cursed


king philip

good reverend father make my person yours
and tell me how you would bestow yourself
this royal hand and mine are newly knit
and the conjunction of our inward souls
married in league coupled and linked together
with all religious strength of sacred vows
the latest breath that gave the sound of words
was deep-sworn faith peace amity true love
between our kingdoms and our royal selves
and even before this truce but new before
no longer than we well could wash our hands
to clap this royal bargain up of peace
heaven knows they were besmear and over-stain
with slaughter pencil where revenge did paint
the fearful difference of incensed kings
and shall these hands so lately purged of blood
so newly join in love so strong in both
unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet
play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven
make such unconstant children of ourselves
as now again to snatch our palm from palm
unswear faith sworn and on the marriage-bed
of smiling peace to march a bloody host
and make a riot on the gentle brow
of true sincerity o holy sir
my reverend father let it not be so
out of your grace devise ordain impose
some gentle order and then we shall be blest
to do your pleasure and continue friends


cardinal pandulph

all form is formless order orderless
save what is opposite to england love
therefore to arms be champion of our church
or let the church our mother breathe her curse
a mother curse on her revolting son
france thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue
a chafed lion by the mortal paw
a fasting tiger safer by the tooth
than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold


king philip

i may disjoin my hand but not my faith


cardinal pandulph

so makest thou faith an enemy to faith
and like a civil war set oath to oath
thy tongue against thy tongue o let thy vow
first made to heaven first be to heaven perform
that is to be the champion of our church
what since thou sworest is sworn against thyself
and may not be performed by thyself
for that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
is not amiss when it is truly done
and being not done where doing tends to ill
the truth is then most done not doing it
the better act of purposes mistook
is to mistake again though indirect
yet indirection thereby grows direct
and falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools fire
within the scorched veins of one new-burn
it is religion that doth make vows kept
but thou hast sworn against religion
by what thou swear against the thing thou swear
and makest an oath the surety for thy truth
against an oath the truth thou art unsure
to swear swears only not to be forsworn
else what a mockery should it be to swear
but thou dost swear only to be forsworn
and most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear
therefore thy later vows against thy first
is in thyself rebellion to thyself
and better conquest never canst thou make
than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
against these giddy loose suggestions
upon which better part our prayers come in
if thou vouchsafe them but if not then know
the peril of our curses light on thee
so heavy as thou shalt not shake them off
but in despair die under their black weight


austria

rebellion flat rebellion


bastard

willt not be
will not a calfs-skin stop that mouth of thine


lewis

father to arms


blanch

upon thy wedding-day
against the blood that thou hast married
what shall our feast be kept with slaughter men
shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums
clamours of hell be measures to our pomp
o husband hear me ay alack how new
is husband in my mouth even for that name
which till this time my tongue did neer pronounce
upon my knee i beg go not to arms
against mine uncle


constance

o upon my knee
made hard with kneeling i do pray to thee
thou virtuous dauphin alter not the doom
forethought by heaven


blanch

now shall i see thy love what motive may
be stronger with thee than the name of wife


constance

that which upholdeth him that thee upholds
his honour o thine honour lewis thine honour


lewis

come hither hubert o my gentle hubert
we owe thee much within this wall of flesh
there is a soul counts thee her creditor
and with advantage means to pay thy love
and my good friend thy voluntary oath
lives in this bosom dearly cherished
give me thy hand i had a thing to say
but i will fit it with some better time
by heaven hubert i am almost ashamed
to say what good respect i have of thee


hubert

i am much bounden to your majesty


king john

good friend thou hast no cause to say so yet
but thou shalt have and creep time neer so slow
yet it shall come from me to do thee good
i had a thing to say but let it go
the sun is in the heaven and the proud day
attended with the pleasures of the world
is all too wanton and too full of gawds
to give me audience if the midnight bell
did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth
sound on into the drowsy race of night
if this same were a churchyard where we stand
and thou possessed with a thousand wrongs
or if that surly spirit melancholy
had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick
which else runs tickling up and down the veins
making that idiot laughter keep men eyes
and strain their cheeks to idle merriment
a passion hateful to my purposes
or if that thou couldst see me without eyes
hear me without thine ears and make reply
without a tongue using conceit alone
without eyes ears and harmful sound of words
then in despite of brooded watchful day
i would into thy bosom pour my thoughts
but ah i will not yet i love thee well
and by my troth i think thou lovest me well


hubert

so well that what you bid me undertake
though that my death were adjunct to my act
by heaven i would do it


king john

do not i know thou wouldst
good hubert hubert hubert throw thine eye
on yon young boy ill tell thee what my friend
he is a very serpent in my way
and wheresoer this foot of mine doth tread
he lies before me dost thou understand me
thou art his keeper

that he shall not offend your majesty

king philip

so by a roaring tempest on the flood
a whole armado of convicted sail
is scatter and disjoin from fellowship


cardinal pandulph

courage and comfort all shall yet go well


king philip

what can go well when we have run so ill
are we not beaten is not angiers lost
arthur taen prisoner divers dear friends slain
and bloody england into england gone
oerbearing interruption spite of france


lewis

what he hath won that hath he fortified
so hot a speed with such advice disposed
such temperate order in so fierce a cause
doth want example who hath read or heard
of any kindred action like to this


king philip

well could i bear that england had this praise
so we could find some pattern of our shame
enter constance
look who comes here a grave unto a soul
holding the eternal spirit against her will
in the vile prison of afflicted breath
i prithee lady go away with me


constance

lo now i now see the issue of your peace


king philip

patience good lady comfort gentle constance


constance

no i defy all counsel all redress
but that which ends all counsel true redress
death death o amiable lovely death
thou odouriferous stench sound rottenness
arise forth from the couch of lasting night
thou hate and terror to prosperity
and i will kiss thy detestable bones
and put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
and ring these fingers with thy household worms
and stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
and be a carrion monster like thyself
come grin on me and i will think thou smilest
and buss thee as thy wife misery love
o come to me


king philip

o fair affliction peace


constance

no no i will not having breath to cry
o that my tongue were in the thunder mouth
then with a passion would i shake the world
and rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
which cannot hear a lady feeble voice
which scorns a modern invocation


cardinal pandulph

lady you utter madness and not sorrow


constance

thou art not holy to belie me so
i am not mad this hair i tear is mine
my name is constance i was geffrey wife
young arthur is my son and he is lost
i am not mad i would to heaven i were
for then tis like i should forget myself
o if i could what grief should i forget
preach some philosophy to make me mad
and thou shalt be canonized cardinal
for being not mad but sensible of grief
my reasonable part produces reason
how i may be deliver of these woes
and teaches me to kill or hang myself
if i were mad i should forget my son
or madly think a babe of clouts were he
i am not mad too well too well i feel
the different plague of each calamity


king philip

bind up those tresses o what love i note
in the fair multitude of those her hairs
where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen
even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
do glue themselves in sociable grief
like true inseparable faithful loves
sticking together in calamity


constance

to england if you will


king philip

bind up your hairs


constance

yes that i will and wherefore will i do it
i tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
o that these hands could so redeem my son
as they have given these hairs their liberty
but now i envy at their liberty
and will again commit them to their bonds
because my poor child is a prisoner
and father cardinal i have heard you say
that we shall see and know our friends in heaven
if that be true i shall see my boy again
for since the birth of cain the first male child
to him that did but yesterday suspire
there was not such a gracious creature born
but now will canker-sorrow eat my bud
and chase the native beauty from his cheek
and he will look as hollow as a ghost
as dim and meagre as an ague fit
and so hell die and rising so again
when i shall meet him in the court of heaven
i shall not know him therefore never never
must i behold my pretty arthur more


cardinal pandulph

you hold too heinous a respect of grief


constance

he talks to me that never had a son


king philip

you are as fond of grief as of your child


constance

grief fills the room up of my absent child
lies in his bed walks up and down with me
puts on his pretty looks repeats his words
remembers me of all his gracious parts
stuffs out his vacant garments with his form
then have i reason to be fond of grief
fare you well had you such a loss as i
i could give better comfort than you do
i will not keep this form upon my head
when there is such disorder in my wit
o lord my boy my arthur my fair son
my life my joy my food my all the world
my widow-comfort and my sorrows cure
exit


king philip

i fear some outrage and ill follow her
exit


lewis

there nothing in this world can make me joy
life is as tedious as a twice-told tale
vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man
and bitter shame hath spoil the sweet world taste
that it yields nought but shame and bitterness


cardinal pandulph

before the curing of a strong disease
even in the instant of repair and health
the fit is strongest evils that take leave
on their departure most of all show evil
what have you lost by losing of this day


lewis

all days of glory joy and happiness


cardinal pandulph

if you had won it certainly you had
no no when fortune means to men most good
she looks upon them with a threatening eye
tis strange to think how much king john hath lost
in this which he accounts so clearly won
are not you grieved that arthur is his prisoner


lewis

as heartily as he is glad he hath him


cardinal pandulph

your mind is all as youthful as your blood
now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit
for even the breath of what i mean to speak
shall blow each dust each straw each little rub
out of the path which shall directly lead
thy foot to england throne and therefore mark
john hath seized arthur and it cannot be
that whiles warm life plays in that infant veins
the misplaced john should entertain an hour
one minute nay one quiet breath of rest
a sceptre snatch with an unruly hand
must be as boisterously maintain as gain
and he that stands upon a slippery place
makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up
that john may stand then arthur needs must fall
so be it for it cannot be but so


lewis

but what shall i gain by young arthur fall


cardinal pandulph

you in the right of lady blanch your wife
may then make all the claim that arthur did


lewis

and lose it life and all as arthur did


cardinal pandulph

how green you are and fresh in this old world
john lays you plots the times conspire with you
for he that steeps his safety in true blood
shall find but bloody safety and untrue
this act so evilly born shall cool the hearts
of all his people and freeze up their zeal
that none so small advantage shall step forth
to cheque his reign but they will cherish it
no natural exhalation in the sky
no scope of nature no distemper day
no common wind no customed event
but they will pluck away his natural cause
and call them meteors prodigies and signs
abortives presages and tongues of heaven
plainly denouncing vengeance upon john


lewis

may be he will not touch young arthur life
but hold himself safe in his prisonment


cardinal pandulph

o sir when he shall hear of your approach
if that young arthur be not gone already
even at that news he dies and then the hearts
of all his people shall revolt from him
and kiss the lips of unacquainted change
and pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
out of the bloody fingers ends of john
methinks i see this hurly all on foot
and o what better matter breeds for you
than i have named the bastard faulconbridge
is now in england ransacking the church
offending charity if but a dozen french
were there in arms they would be as a call
to train ten thousand english to their side
or as a little snow tumbled about
anon becomes a mountain o noble dauphin
go with me to the king tis wonderful
what may be wrought out of their discontent
now that their souls are topful of offence
for england go i will whet on the king


lewis

strong reasons make strong actions let us go
if you say ay the king will not say no

act iv
scene i a room in a castle

enter hubert and executioners


hubert

heat me these irons hot and look thou stand
within the arras when i strike my foot
upon the bosom of the ground rush forth
and bind the boy which you shall find with me
fast to the chair be heedful hence and watch


first executioner

i hope your warrant will bear out the deed


hubert

uncleanly scruples fear not you look tot
exeunt executioners
young lad come forth i have to say with you
enter arthur


arthur

good morrow hubert


hubert

good morrow little prince


arthur

as little prince having so great a title
to be more prince as may be you are sad


hubert

indeed i have been merrier


arthur

mercy on me
methinks no body should be sad but i
yet i remember when i was in france
young gentlemen would be as sad as night
only for wantonness by my christendom
so i were out of prison and kept sheep
i should be as merry as the day is long
and so i would be here but that i doubt
my uncle practises more harm to me
he is afraid of me and i of him
is it my fault that i was geffrey son
no indeed ist not and i would to heaven
i were your son so you would love me hubert


hubert

aside  if i talk to him with his innocent prate
he will awake my mercy which lies dead
therefore i will be sudden and dispatch


arthur

are you sick hubert you look pale to-day
in sooth i would you were a little sick
that i might sit all night and watch with you
i warrant i love you more than you do me


hubert

aside  his words do take possession of my bosom
read here young arthur
showing a paper
aside
how now foolish rheum
turning dispiteous torture out of door
i must be brief lest resolution drop
out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears
can you not read it is it not fair writ


arthur

too fairly hubert for so foul effect
must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes


hubert

young boy i must


arthur

and will you


hubert

and i will


arthur

have you the heart when your head did but ache
i knit my handercher about your brows
the best i had a princess wrought it me
and i did never ask it you again
and with my hand at midnight held your head
and like the watchful minutes to the hour
still and anon cheer up the heavy time
saying what lack you and where lies your grief
or what good love may i perform for you
many a poor man son would have lien still
and neer have spoke a loving word to you
but you at your sick service had a prince
nay you may think my love was crafty love
and call it cunning do an if you will
if heaven be pleased that you must use me ill
why then you must will you put out mine eyes
these eyes that never did nor never shall
so much as frown on you


hubert

i have sworn to do it
and with hot irons must i burn them out


arthur

ah none but in this iron age would do it
the iron of itself though heat red-hot
approaching near these eyes would drink my tears
and quench his fiery indignation
even in the matter of mine innocence
nay after that consume away in rust
but for containing fire to harm mine eye
are you more stubborn-hard than hammer iron
an if an angel should have come to me
and told me hubert should put out mine eyes
i would not have believed him no tongue but hubert


hubert

come forth
stamps
re-enter executioners with a cord irons   c
do as i bid you do


arthur

o save me hubert save me my eyes are out
even with the fierce looks of these bloody men


hubert

give me the iron i say and bind him here


arthur

alas what need you be so boisterous-rough
i will not struggle i will stand stone-still
for heaven sake hubert let me not be bound
nay hear me hubert drive these men away
and i will sit as quiet as a lamb
i will not stir nor wince nor speak a word
nor look upon the iron angerly
thrust but these men away and ill forgive you
whatever torment you do put me to


hubert

go stand within let me alone with him


first executioner

i am best pleased to be from such a deed
exeunt executioners


arthur

alas i then have chid away my friend
he hath a stern look but a gentle heart
let him come back that his compassion may
give life to yours


hubert

come boy prepare yourself


arthur

is there no remedy


hubert

none but to lose your eyes


arthur

o heaven that there were but a mote in yours
a grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair
any annoyance in that precious sense
then feeling what small things are boisterous there
your vile intent must needs seem horrible


hubert

is this your promise go to hold your tongue


arthur

hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues
must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes
let me not hold my tongue let me not hubert
or hubert if you will cut out my tongue
so i may keep mine eyes o spare mine eyes
though to no use but still to look on you
lo by my truth the instrument is cold
and would not harm me


hubert

i can heat it boy


arthur

no in good sooth the fire is dead with grief
being create for comfort to be used
in undeserved extremes see else yourself
there is no malice in this burning coal
the breath of heaven has blown his spirit out
and strew repentent ashes on his head


hubert

but with my breath i can revive it boy


arthur

an if you do you will but make it blush
and glow with shame of your proceedings hubert
nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes
and like a dog that is compell to fight
snatch at his master that doth tarre him on
all things that you should use to do me wrong
deny their office only you do lack
that mercy which fierce fire and iron extends
creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses


hubert

well see to live i will not touch thine eye
for all the treasure that thine uncle owes
yet am i sworn and i did purpose boy
with this same very iron to burn them out


arthur

o now you look like hubert all this while
you were disguised


hubert

peace no more adieu
your uncle must not know but you are dead
ill fill these dogged spies with false reports
and pretty child sleep doubtless and secure
that hubert for the wealth of all the world
will not offend thee


arthur

o heaven i thank you hubert


hubert

silence no more go closely in with me
much danger do i undergo for thee

scene ii king john palace

enter king john pembroke salisbury and other lords


king john

here once again we sit once again crown
and looked upon i hope with cheerful eyes


pembroke

this once again but that your highness pleased
was once superfluous you were crown before
and that high royalty was neer pluck off
the faiths of men neer stained with revolt
fresh expectation troubled not the land
with any long-for change or better state


salisbury

therefore to be possess with double pomp
to guard a title that was rich before
to gild refined gold to paint the lily
to throw a perfume on the violet
to smooth the ice or add another hue
unto the rainbow or with taper-light
to seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish
is wasteful and ridiculous excess


pembroke

but that your royal pleasure must be done
this act is as an ancient tale new told
and in the last repeating troublesome
being urged at a time unseasonable


salisbury

in this the antique and well noted face
of plain old form is much disfigured
and like a shifted wind unto a sail
it makes the course of thoughts to fetch about
startles and frights consideration
makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected
for putting on so new a fashion robe


pembroke

when workmen strive to do better than well
they do confound their skill in covetousness
and oftentimes excusing of a fault
doth make the fault the worse by the excuse
as patches set upon a little breach
discredit more in hiding of the fault
than did the fault before it was so patch


salisbury

to this effect before you were new crown
we breathed our counsel but it pleased your highness
to overbear it and we are all well pleased
since all and every part of what we would
doth make a stand at what your highness will


king john

some reasons of this double coronation
i have possess you with and think them strong
and more more strong then lesser is my fear
i shall indue you with meantime but ask
what you would have reform that is not well
and well shall you perceive how willingly
i will both hear and grant you your requests


pembroke

then i as one that am the tongue of these
to sound the purpose of all their hearts
both for myself and them but chief of all
your safety for the which myself and them
bend their best studies heartily request
the enfranchisement of arthur whose restraint
doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
to break into this dangerous argument 
if what in rest you have in right you hold
why then your fears which as they say attend
the steps of wrong should move you to mew up
your tender kinsman and to choke his days
with barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
the rich advantage of good exercise
that the time enemies may not have this
to grace occasions let it be our suit
that you have bid us ask his liberty
which for our goods we do no further ask
than whereupon our weal on you depending
counts it your weal he have his liberty
enter hubert


king john

let it be so i do commit his youth
to your direction hubert what news with you
taking him apart


pembroke

this is the man should do the bloody deed
he show his warrant to a friend of mine
the image of a wicked heinous fault
lives in his eye that close aspect of his
does show the mood of a much troubled breast
and i do fearfully believe tis done
what we so fear he had a charge to do


salisbury

the colour of the king doth come and go
between his purpose and his conscience
like heralds twixt two dreadful battles set
his passion is so ripe it needs must break


pembroke

and when it breaks i fear will issue thence
the foul corruption of a sweet child death


king john

we cannot hold mortality strong hand
good lords although my will to give is living
the suit which you demand is gone and dead
he tells us arthur is deceased to-night


salisbury

indeed we fear his sickness was past cure


pembroke

indeed we heard how near his death he was
before the child himself felt he was sick
this must be answer either here or hence


king john

why do you bend such solemn brows on me
think you i bear the shears of destiny
have i commandment on the pulse of life


salisbury

it is apparent foul play and tis shame
that greatness should so grossly offer it
so thrive it in your game and so farewell


pembroke

stay yet lord salisbury ill go with thee
and find the inheritance of this poor child
his little kingdom of a forced grave
that blood which owed the breadth of all this isle
three foot of it doth hold bad world the while
this must not be thus borne this will break out
to all our sorrows and ere long i doubt
exeunt lords


king john

they burn in indignation i repent
there is no sure foundation set on blood
no certain life achieved by others death
enter a messenger
a fearful eye thou hast where is that blood
that i have seen inhabit in those cheeks
so foul a sky clears not without a storm
pour down thy weather how goes all in france


messenger

from france to england never such a power
for any foreign preparation
was levied in the body of a land
the copy of your speed is learn by them
for when you should be told they do prepare
the tidings come that they are all arrived


king john

o where hath our intelligence been drunk
where hath it slept where is my mother care
that such an army could be drawn in france
and she not hear of it


messenger

my liege her ear
is stopp with dust the first of april died
your noble mother and as i hear my lord
the lady constance in a frenzy died
three days before but this from rumour tongue
i idly heard if true or false i know not


king john

withhold thy speed dreadful occasion
o make a league with me till i have pleased
my discontented peers what mother dead
how wildly then walks my estate in france
under whose conduct came those powers of france
that thou for truth givest out are landed here


messenger

under the dauphin


king john

thou hast made me giddy
with these ill tidings
enter the bastard and peter of pomfret
now what says the world
to your proceedings do not seek to stuff
my head with more ill news for it is full


bastard

but if you be afeard to hear the worst
then let the worst unheard fall on your bead


king john

bear with me cousin for i was amazed
under the tide but now i breathe again
aloft the flood and can give audience
to any tongue speak it of what it will


bastard

how i have sped among the clergymen
the sums i have collected shall express
but as i travell hither through the land
i find the people strangely fantasied
possess with rumours full of idle dreams
not knowing what they fear but full of fear
and here a prophet that i brought with me
from forth the streets of pomfret whom i found
with many hundreds treading on his heels
to whom he sung in rude harsh-sounding rhymes
that ere the next ascension-day at noon
your highness should deliver up your crown


king john

thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so


peter

foreknowing that the truth will fall out so


king john

hubert away with him imprison him
and on that day at noon whereon he says
i shall yield up my crown let him be hang
deliver him to safety and return
for i must use thee
exeunt hubert with peter
o my gentle cousin
hear thou the news abroad who are arrived


bastard

the french my lord men mouths are full of it
besides i met lord bigot and lord salisbury
with eyes as red as new-enkindled fire
and others more going to seek the grave
of arthur who they say is kill to-night
on your suggestion


king john

gentle kinsman go
and thrust thyself into their companies
i have a way to win their loves again
bring them before me


bastard

i will seek them out


king john

nay but make haste the better foot before
o let me have no subject enemies
when adverse foreigners affright my towns
with dreadful pomp of stout invasion
be mercury set feathers to thy heels
and fly like thought from them to me again


bastard

the spirit of the time shall teach me speed
exit


king john

spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman
go after him for he perhaps shall need
some messenger betwixt me and the peers
and be thou he


messenger

with all my heart my liege
exit


king john

my mother dead
re-enter hubert


hubert

my lord they say five moons were seen to-night
four fixed and the fifth did whirl about
the other four in wondrous motion


king john

five moons


hubert

old men and beldams in the streets
do prophesy upon it dangerously
young arthur death is common in their mouths
and when they talk of him they shake their heads
and whisper one another in the ear
and he that speaks doth gripe the hearer wrist
whilst he that hears makes fearful action
with wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes
i saw a smith stand with his hammer thus
the whilst his iron did on the anvil cool
with open mouth swallowing a tailor news
who with his shears and measure in his hand
standing on slippers which his nimble haste
had falsely thrust upon contrary feet
told of a many thousand warlike french
that were embattailed and rank in kent
another lean unwash artificer
cuts off his tale and talks of arthur death


king john

why seek thou to possess me with these fears
why urgest thou so oft young arthur death
thy hand hath murder him i had a mighty cause
to wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him


hubert

no had my lord why did you not provoke me


king john

it is the curse of kings to be attended
by slaves that take their humours for a warrant
to break within the bloody house of life
and on the winking of authority
to understand a law to know the meaning
of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns
more upon humour than advised respect


hubert

here is your hand and seal for what i did


king john

o when the last account twixt heaven and earth
is to be made then shall this hand and seal
witness against us to damnation
how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
make deeds ill done hadst not thou been by
a fellow by the hand of nature mark
quoted and sign to do a deed of shame
this murder had not come into my mind
but taking note of thy abhorr aspect
finding thee fit for bloody villany
apt liable to be employ in danger
i faintly broke with thee of arthur death
and thou to be endeared to a king
made it no conscience to destroy a prince


hubert

my lord 


king john

hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
when i spake darkly what i purposed
or turn an eye of doubt upon my face
as bid me tell my tale in express words
deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off
and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me
but thou didst understand me by my signs
and didst in signs again parley with sin
yea without stop didst let thy heart consent
and consequently thy rude hand to act
the deed which both our tongues held vile to name
out of my sight and never see me more
my nobles leave me and my state is braved
even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers
nay in the body of this fleshly land
this kingdom this confine of blood and breath
hostility and civil tumult reigns
between my conscience and my cousin death


hubert

arm you against your other enemies
ill make a peace between your soul and you
young arthur is alive this hand of mine
is yet a maiden and an innocent hand
not painted with the crimson spots of blood
within this bosom never enter yet
the dreadful motion of a murderous thought
and you have slander nature in my form
which howsoever rude exteriorly
is yet the cover of a fairer mind
than to be butcher of an innocent child


king john

doth arthur live o haste thee to the peers
throw this report on their incensed rage
and make them tame to their obedience
forgive the comment that my passion made
upon thy feature for my rage was blind
and foul imaginary eyes of blood
presented thee more hideous than thou art
o answer not but to my closet bring
the angry lords with all expedient haste
i conjure thee but slowly run more fast

scene iii before the castle

enter arthur on the walls


arthur

the wall is high and yet will i leap down
good ground be pitiful and hurt me not
there few or none do know me if they did
this ship-boy semblance hath disguised me quite
i am afraid and yet ill venture it
if i get down and do not break my limbs
ill find a thousand shifts to get away
as good to die and go as die and stay
leaps down
o me my uncle spirit is in these stones
heaven take my soul and england keep my bones

enter pembroke salisbury and bigot


salisbury

lords i will meet him at saint edmundsbury
it is our safety and we must embrace
this gentle offer of the perilous time


pembroke

who brought that letter from the cardinal


salisbury

the count melun a noble lord of france
whose private with me of the dauphin love
is much more general than these lines import


bigot

to-morrow morning let us meet him then


salisbury

or rather then set forward for twill be
two long days journey lords or ere we meet
enter the bastard


bastard

once more to-day well met distemper lords
the king by me requests your presence straight


salisbury

the king hath dispossess himself of us
we will not line his thin bestained cloak
with our pure honours nor attend the foot
that leaves the print of blood whereer it walks
return and tell him so we know the worst


bastard

whateer you think good words i think were best


salisbury

our griefs and not our manners reason now


bastard

but there is little reason in your grief
therefore twere reason you had manners now


pembroke

sir sir impatience hath his privilege


bastard

tis true to hurt his master no man else


salisbury

this is the prison what is he lies here
seeing arthur


pembroke

o death made proud with pure and princely beauty
the earth had not a hole to hide this deed


salisbury

murder as hating what himself hath done
doth lay it open to urge on revenge


bigot

or when he doom this beauty to a grave
found it too precious-princely for a grave


salisbury

sir richard what think you have you beheld
or have you read or heard or could you think
or do you almost think although you see
that you do see could thought without this object
form such another this is the very top
the height the crest or crest unto the crest
of murder arms this is the bloodiest shame
the wildest savagery the vilest stroke
that ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage
presented to the tears of soft remorse


pembroke

all murders past do stand excused in this
and this so sole and so unmatchable
shall give a holiness a purity
to the yet unbegotten sin of times
and prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest
exampled by this heinous spectacle


bastard

it is a damned and a bloody work
the graceless action of a heavy hand
if that it be the work of any hand


salisbury

if that it be the work of any hand
we had a kind of light what would ensue
it is the shameful work of hubert hand
the practise and the purpose of the king
from whose obedience i forbid my soul
kneeling before this ruin of sweet life
and breathing to his breathless excellence
the incense of a vow a holy vow
never to taste the pleasures of the world
never to be infected with delight
nor conversant with ease and idleness
till i have set a glory to this hand
by giving it the worship of revenge


pembroke

bigot

our souls religiously confirm thy words
enter hubert


hubert

lords i am hot with haste in seeking you
arthur doth live the king hath sent for you


salisbury

o he is old and blushes not at death
avaunt thou hateful villain get thee gone


hubert

i am no villain


salisbury

must i rob the law
drawing his sword


bastard

your sword is bright sir put it up again


salisbury

not till i sheathe it in a murderer skin


hubert

stand back lord salisbury stand back i say
by heaven i think my sword as sharp as yours
i would not have you lord forget yourself
nor tempt the danger of my true defence
lest i by marking of your rage forget
your worth your greatness and nobility


bigot

out dunghill darest thou brave a nobleman


hubert

not for my life but yet i dare defend
my innocent life against an emperor


salisbury

thou art a murderer


hubert

do not prove me so
yet i am none whose tongue soeer speaks false
not truly speaks who speaks not truly lies


pembroke

cut him to pieces


bastard

keep the peace i say


salisbury

stand by or i shall gall you faulconbridge


bastard

thou wert better gall the devil salisbury
if thou but frown on me or stir thy foot
or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame
ill strike thee dead put up thy sword betime
or ill so maul you and your toasting-iron
that you shall think the devil is come from hell


bigot

what wilt thou do renowned faulconbridge
second a villain and a murderer


hubert

lord bigot i am none


bigot

who kill this prince


hubert

tis not an hour since i left him well
i honour him i loved him and will weep
my date of life out for his sweet life loss


salisbury

trust not those cunning waters of his eyes
for villany is not without such rheum
and he long traded in it makes it seem
like rivers of remorse and innocency
away with me all you whose souls abhor
the uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house
for i am stifled with this smell of sin


bigot

away toward bury to the dauphin there


pembroke

there tell the king he may inquire us out
exeunt lords


bastard

here a good world knew you of this fair work
beyond the infinite and boundless reach
of mercy if thou didst this deed of death
art thou damn hubert


hubert

do but hear me sir


bastard

ha ill tell thee what
thourt damn as black nay nothing is so black
thou art more deep damn than prince lucifer
there is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
as thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child


hubert

upon my soul 


bastard

if thou didst but consent
to this most cruel act do but despair
and if thou want a cord the smallest thread
that ever spider twisted from her womb
will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam
to hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself
put but a little water in a spoon
and it shall be as all the ocean
enough to stifle such a villain up
i do suspect thee very grievously


hubert

if i in act consent or sin of thought
be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
which was embounded in this beauteous clay
let hell want pains enough to torture me
i left him well


bastard

go bear him in thine arms
i am amazed methinks and lose my way
among the thorns and dangers of this world
how easy dost thou take all england up
from forth this morsel of dead royalty
the life the right and truth of all this realm
is fled to heaven and england now is left
to tug and scamble and to part by the teeth
the unowed interest of proud-swelling state
now for the bare-pick bone of majesty
doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
and snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace
now powers from home and discontents at home
meet in one line and vast confusion waits
as doth a raven on a sick-falln beast
the imminent decay of wrested pomp
now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
hold out this tempest bear away that child
and follow me with speed ill to the king
a thousand businesses are brief in hand
and heaven itself doth frown upon the land

scene i king john palace

enter king john cardinal pandulph and attendants


king john

thus have i yielded up into your hand
the circle of my glory
giving the crown


cardinal pandulph

take again
from this my hand as holding of the pope
your sovereign greatness and authority


king john

now keep your holy word go meet the french
and from his holiness use all your power
to stop their marches fore we are inflamed
our discontented counties do revolt
our people quarrel with obedience
swearing allegiance and the love of soul
to stranger blood to foreign royalty
this inundation of mistemper humour
rests by you only to be qualified
then pause not for the present time so sick
that present medicine must be minister
or overthrow incurable ensues


cardinal pandulph

it was my breath that blew this tempest up
upon your stubborn usage of the pope
but since you are a gentle convertite
my tongue shall hush again this storm of war
and make fair weather in your blustering land
on this ascension-day remember well
upon your oath of service to the pope
go i to make the french lay down their arms
exit


king john

is this ascension-day did not the prophet
say that before ascension-day at noon
my crown i should give off even so i have
i did suppose it should be on constraint
but heaven be thank it is but voluntary
enter the bastard


bastard

all kent hath yielded nothing there holds out
but dover castle london hath received
like a kind host the dauphin and his powers
your nobles will not hear you but are gone
to offer service to your enemy
and wild amazement hurries up and down
the little number of your doubtful friends


king john

would not my lords return to me again
after they heard young arthur was alive


bastard

they found him dead and cast into the streets
an empty casket where the jewel of life
by some damn hand was robb and taen away


king john

that villain hubert told me he did live


bastard

so on my soul he did for aught he knew
but wherefore do you droop why look you sad
be great in act as you have been in thought
let not the world see fear and sad distrust
govern the motion of a kingly eye
be stirring as the time be fire with fire
threaten the threatener and outface the brow
of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes
that borrow their behaviors from the great
grow great by your example and put on
the dauntless spirit of resolution
away and glister like the god of war
when he intendeth to become the field
show boldness and aspiring confidence
what shall they seek the lion in his den
and fright him there and make him tremble there
o let it not be said forage and run
to meet displeasure farther from the doors
and grapple with him ere he comes so nigh


king john

the legate of the pope hath been with me
and i have made a happy peace with him
and he hath promised to dismiss the powers
led by the dauphin


bastard

o inglorious league
shall we upon the footing of our land
send fair-play orders and make compromise
insinuation parley and base truce
to arms invasive shall a beardless boy
a cocker silken wanton brave our fields
and flesh his spirit in a warlike soil
mocking the air with colours idly spread
and find no cheque let us my liege to arms
perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace
or if he do let it at least be said
they saw we had a purpose of defence


king john

have thou the ordering of this present time


bastard

away then with good courage yet i know
our party may well meet a prouder foe

scene ii lewis camp at st edmundsbury

lewis

my lord melun let this be copied out
and keep it safe for our remembrance
return the precedent to these lords again
that having our fair order written down
both they and we perusing oer these notes
may know wherefore we took the sacrament
and keep our faiths firm and inviolable


salisbury

upon our sides it never shall be broken
and noble dauphin albeit we swear
a voluntary zeal and an unurged faith
to your proceedings yet believe me prince
i am not glad that such a sore of time
should seek a plaster by contemn revolt
and heal the inveterate canker of one wound
by making many o it grieves my soul
that i must draw this metal from my side
to be a widow-maker o and there
where honourable rescue and defence
cries out upon the name of salisbury
but such is the infection of the time
that for the health and physic of our right
we cannot deal but with the very hand
of stern injustice and confused wrong
and ist not pity o my grieved friends
that we the sons and children of this isle
were born to see so sad an hour as this
wherein we step after a stranger march
upon her gentle bosom and fill up
her enemies ranks i must withdraw and weep
upon the spot of this enforced cause 
to grace the gentry of a land remote
and follow unacquainted colours here
what here o nation that thou couldst remove
that neptune arms who clippeth thee about
would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself
and grapple thee unto a pagan shore
where these two christian armies might combine
the blood of malice in a vein of league
and not to spend it so unneighbourly


lewis

a noble temper dost thou show in this
and great affections wrestling in thy bosom
doth make an earthquake of nobility
o what a noble combat hast thou fought
between compulsion and a brave respect
let me wipe off this honourable dew
that silverly doth progress on thy cheeks
my heart hath melted at a lady tears
being an ordinary inundation
but this effusion of such manly drops
this shower blown up by tempest of the soul
startles mine eyes and makes me more amazed
than had i seen the vaulty top of heaven
figured quite oer with burning meteors
lift up thy brow renowned salisbury
and with a great heart heave away the storm
commend these waters to those baby eyes
that never saw the giant world enraged
nor met with fortune other than at feasts
full of warm blood of mirth of gossiping
come come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
into the purse of rich prosperity
as lewis himself so nobles shall you all
that knit your sinews to the strength of mine
and even there methinks an angel spake
enter cardinal pandulph
look where the holy legate comes apace
to give us warrant from the hand of heaven
and on our actions set the name of right
with holy breath


cardinal pandulph

hail noble prince of france
the next is this king john hath reconciled
himself to rome his spirit is come in
that so stood out against the holy church
the great metropolis and see of rome
therefore thy threatening colours now wind up
and tame the savage spirit of wild war
that like a lion foster up at hand
it may lie gently at the foot of peace
and be no further harmful than in show


lewis

your grace shall pardon me i will not back
i am too high-born to be propertied
to be a secondary at control
or useful serving-man and instrument
to any sovereign state throughout the world
your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
between this chastised kingdom and myself
and brought in matter that should feed this fire
and now tis far too huge to be blown out
with that same weak wind which enkindled it
you taught me how to know the face of right
acquainted me with interest to this land
yea thrust this enterprise into my heart
and come ye now to tell me john hath made
his peace with rome what is that peace to me
i by the honour of my marriage-bed
after young arthur claim this land for mine
and now it is half-conquer must i back
because that john hath made his peace with rome
am i rome slave what penny hath rome borne
what men provided what munition sent
to underprop this action ist not i
that undergo this charge who else but i
and such as to my claim are liable
sweat in this business and maintain this war
have i not heard these islanders shout out
vive le roi as i have bank their towns
have i not here the best cards for the game
to win this easy match play for a crown
and shall i now give oer the yielded set
no no on my soul it never shall be said


cardinal pandulph

you look but on the outside of this work


lewis

outside or inside i will not return
till my attempt so much be glorified
as to my ample hope was promised
before i drew this gallant head of war
and cull these fiery spirits from the world
to outlook conquest and to win renown
even in the jaws of danger and of death
trumpet sounds
what lusty trumpet thus doth summon us
enter the bastard attended


bastard

according to the fair play of the world
let me have audience i am sent to speak
my holy lord of milan from the king
i come to learn how you have dealt for him
and as you answer i do know the scope
and warrant limited unto my tongue


cardinal pandulph

the dauphin is too wilful-opposite
and will not temporize with my entreaties
he flatly says hell not lay down his arms


bastard

by all the blood that ever fury breathed
the youth says well now hear our english king
for thus his royalty doth speak in me
he is prepared and reason too he should
this apish and unmannerly approach
this harness masque and unadvised revel
this unhair sauciness and boyish troops
the king doth smile at and is well prepared
to whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms
from out the circle of his territories
that hand which had the strength even at your door
to cudgel you and make you take the hatch
to dive like buckets in concealed wells
to crouch in litter of your stable planks
to lie like pawns lock up in chests and trunks
to hug with swine to seek sweet safety out
in vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake
even at the crying of your nation crow
thinking his voice an armed englishman
shall that victorious hand be feebled here
that in your chambers gave you chastisement
no know the gallant monarch is in arms
and like an eagle oer his aery towers
to souse annoyance that comes near his nest
and you degenerate you ingrate revolts
you bloody neroes ripping up the womb
of your dear mother england blush for shame
for your own ladies and pale-visaged maids
like amazons come tripping after drums
their thimbles into armed gauntlets change
their needles to lances and their gentle hearts
to fierce and bloody inclination


lewis

there end thy brave and turn thy face in peace
we grant thou canst outscold us fare thee well
we hold our time too precious to be spent
with such a brabbler


cardinal pandulph

give me leave to speak


bastard

no i will speak


lewis

we will attend to neither
strike up the drums and let the tongue of war
plead for our interest and our being here


bastard

indeed your drums being beaten will cry out
and so shall you being beaten do but start
an echo with the clamour of thy drum
and even at hand a drum is ready braced
that shall reverberate all as loud as thine
sound but another and another shall
as loud as thine rattle the welkin ear
and mock the deep-mouth thunder for at hand
not trusting to this halting legate here
whom he hath used rather for sport than need
is warlike john and in his forehead sits
a bare-ribb death whose office is this day
to feast upon whole thousands of the french


lewis

strike up our drums to find this danger out


bastard

and thou shalt find it dauphin do not doubt

retaining but a quantity of life
which bleeds away even as a form of wax

since i must lose the use of all deceit
why should i then be false since it is true
that i must die here and live hence by truth
i say again if lewis do win the day
he is forsworn if eer those eyes of yours
behold another day break in the east
but even this night whose black contagious breath
already smokes about the burning crest
of the old feeble and day-wearied sun
even this ill night your breathing shall expire
paying the fine of rated treachery
even with a treacherous fine of all your lives
if lewis by your assistance win the day
commend me to one hubert with your king
the love of him and this respect besides
for that my grandsire was an englishman
awakes my conscience to confess all this
in lieu whereof i pray you bear me hence
from forth the noise and rumour of the field
where i may think the remnant of my thoughts
in peace and part this body and my soul
with contemplation and devout desires


salisbury

we do believe thee and beshrew my soul
but i do love the favour and the form
of this most fair occasion by the which
we will untread the steps of damned flight
and like a bated and retired flood
leaving our rankness and irregular course
stoop low within those bounds we have oerlook
and cabby run on in obedience
even to our ocean to our great king john
my arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence
for i do see the cruel pangs of death
right in thine eye away my friends new flight

pembroke

he is more patient
than when you left him even now he sung


prince henry

o vanity of sickness fierce extremes
in their continuance will not feel themselves
death having prey upon the outward parts
leaves them invisible and his siege is now
against the mind the which he pricks and wounds
with many legions of strange fantasies
whi ch in their throng and press to that last hold
confound themselves tis strange that death
should sing
i am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
who chants a doleful hymn to his own death
and from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
his soul and body to their lasting rest

be of good comfort prince for you are born
to set a form upon that indigest
which he hath left so shapeless and so rude

upon a parchment and against this fire
do i shrink up

how fares your majesty


king john

poison ill fare dead forsook cast off
and none of you will bid the winter come
to thrust his icy fingers in my maw
nor let my kingdom rivers take their course
through my burn bosom nor entreat the north
to make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
and comfort me with cold i do not ask you much
i beg cold comfort and you are so strait
and so ingrateful you deny me that

that might relieve you

bastard

o i am scalded with my violent motion
and spleen of speed to see your majesty


king john

o cousin thou art come to set mine eye
the tackle of my heart is crack and burn
and all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
are turned to one thread one little hair
my heart hath one poor string to stay it by
which holds but till thy news be uttered
and then all this thou seest is but a clod
and module of confounded royalty


bastard

the dauphin is preparing hitherward
where heaven he knows how we shall answer him
for in a night the best part of my power
as i upon advantage did remove
were in the washes all unwarily
devoured by the unexpected flood

you breathe these dead news in as dead an ear
my liege my lord but now a king now thus

even so must i run on and even so stop
what surety of the world what hope what stay
when this was now a king and now is clay


bastard

art thou gone so i do but stay behind
to do the office for thee of revenge
and then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven
as it on earth hath been thy servant still
now now you stars that move in your right spheres
where be your powers show now your mended faiths
and instantly return with me again
to push destruction and perpetual shame
out of the weak door of our fainting land
straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought
the dauphin rages at our very heels


salisbury

it seems you know not then so much as we
the cardinal pandulph is within at rest
who half an hour since came from the dauphin
and brings from him such offers of our peace
as we with honour and respect may take
with purpose presently to leave this war


bastard

he will the rather do it when he sees
ourselves well sinewed to our defence


salisbury

nay it is in a manner done already
for many carriages he hath dispatch
to the sea-side and put his cause and quarrel
to the disposing of the cardinal
with whom yourself myself and other lords
if you think meet this afternoon will post
to consummate this business happily


bastard

let it be so and you my noble prince
with other princes that may best be spared
shall wait upon your father funeral


prince henry

at worcester must his body be interr
for so he will it


bastard

thither shall it then
and happily may your sweet self put on
the lineal state and glory of the land
to whom with all submission on my knee
i do bequeath my faithful services
and true subjection everlastingly


salisbury

and the like tender of our love we make
to rest without a spot for evermore


prince henry

i have a kind soul that would give you thanks
and knows not how to do it but with tears


bastard

o let us pay the time but needful woe
since it hath been beforehand with our griefs
this england never did nor never shall
lie at the proud foot of a conqueror
but when it first did help to wound itself
now these her princes are come home again
come the three corners of the world in arms
and we shall shock them nought shall make us rue

of your profession speak what trade art thou


first commoner

why sir a carpenter


marullus

where is thy leather apron and thy rule
what dost thou with thy best apparel on
you sir what trade are you


second commoner

truly sir in respect of a fine workman i am but
as you would say a cobbler


marullus

but what trade art thou answer me directly


second commoner

a trade sir that i hope i may use with a safe
conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles


marullus

what trade thou knave thou naughty knave what trade


second commoner

nay i beseech you sir be not out with me yet
if you be out sir i can mend you


marullus

what meanest thou by that mend me thou saucy fellow


second commoner

why sir cobble you


flavius

thou art a cobbler art thou


second commoner

truly sir all that i live by is with the awl i
meddle with no tradesman matters nor women
matters but with awl i am indeed sir a surgeon
to old shoes when they are in great danger i
recover them as proper men as ever trod upon
neat leather have gone upon my handiwork


flavius

but wherefore art not in thy shop today
why dost thou lead these men about the streets


second commoner

truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself
into more work but indeed sir we make holiday
to see caesar and to rejoice in his triumph


marullus

wherefore rejoice what conquest brings he home
what tributaries follow him to rome
to grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels
you blocks you stones you worse than senseless things
o you hard hearts you cruel men of rome
knew you not pompey many a time and oft
have you climb up to walls and battlements
to towers and windows yea to chimney-tops
your infants in your arms and there have sat
the livelong day with patient expectation
to see great pompey pass the streets of rome
and when you saw his chariot but appear
have you not made an universal shout
that tiber trembled underneath her banks
to hear the replication of your sounds
made in her concave shores
and do you now put on your best attire
and do you now cull out a holiday
and do you now strew flowers in his way
that comes in triumph over pompey blood be gone
run to your houses fall upon your knees
pray to the gods to intermit the plague
that needs must light on this ingratitude


flavius

go go good countrymen and for this fault
assemble all the poor men of your sort
draw them to tiber banks and weep your tears
into the channel till the lowest stream
do kiss the most exalted shores of all
exeunt all the commoners
see whether their basest metal be not moved
they vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness
go you down that way towards the capitol


this way will i

disrobe the images
if you do find them deck with ceremonies


marullus

may we do so
you know it is the feast of lupercal


flavius

it is no matter let no images
be hung with caesar trophies ill about
and drive away the vulgar from the streets
so do you too where you perceive them thick
these growing feathers pluck from caesar wing
will make him fly an ordinary pitch
who else would soar above the view of men
and keep us all in servile fearfulness

calpurnia

here my lord


caesar

stand you directly in antonius way
when he doth run his course antonius


antony

caesar my lord


caesar

forget not in your speed antonius
to touch calpurnia for our elders say
the barren touched in this holy chase
shake off their sterile curse


antony

i shall remember
when caesar says o this it is perform


caesar

set on and leave no ceremony out
flourish


soothsayer

caesar


caesar

ha who calls


casca

bid every noise be still peace yet again


caesar

who is it in the press that calls on me
i hear a tongue shriller than all the music
cry caesar speak caesar is turn to hear


soothsayer

beware the ides of march


caesar

what man is that


brutus

a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march


caesar

set him before me let me see his face


cassius

fellow come from the throng look upon caesar


caesar

what say thou to me now speak once again


soothsayer

beware the ides of march


caesar

he is a dreamer let us leave him pass
sennet exeunt all except brutus and cassius


cassius

will you go see the order of the course


brutus

not i


cassius

i pray you do


brutus

i am not gamesome i do lack some part
of that quick spirit that is in antony
let me not hinder cassius your desires
ill leave you


cassius

brutus i do observe you now of late
i have not from your eyes that gentleness
and show of love as i was wont to have
you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
over your friend that loves you


brutus

cassius
be not deceived if i have veil my look
i turn the trouble of my countenance
merely upon myself vexed i am
of late with passions of some difference
conceptions only proper to myself
which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors
but let not therefore my good friends be grieved 
among which number cassius be you one 
nor construe any further my neglect
than that poor brutus with himself at war
forgets the shows of love to other men


cassius

then brutus i have much mistook your passion
by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
thoughts of great value worthy cogitations
tell me good brutus can you see your face


brutus

no cassius for the eye sees not itself
but by reflection by some other things


cassius

tis just
and it is very much lamented brutus
that you have no such mirrors as will turn
your hidden worthiness into your eye
that you might see your shadow i have heard
where many of the best respect in rome
except immortal caesar speaking of brutus
and groaning underneath this age yoke
have wish that noble brutus had his eyes


brutus

into what dangers would you lead me cassius
that you would have me seek into myself
for that which is not in me


cassius

therefore good brutus be prepared to hear
and since you know you cannot see yourself
so well as by reflection i your glass
will modestly discover to yourself
that of yourself which you yet know not of
and be not jealous on me gentle brutus
were i a common laugher or did use
to stale with ordinary oaths my love
to every new protester if you know
that i do fawn on men and hug them hard
and after scandal them or if you know
that i profess myself in banqueting
to all the rout then hold me dangerous
flourish and shout


brutus

what means this shouting i do fear the people
choose caesar for their king


cassius

ay do you fear it
then must i think you would not have it so


brutus

i would not cassius yet i love him well
but wherefore do you hold me here so long
what is it that you would impart to me
if it be aught toward the general good
set honour in one eye and death i the other
and i will look on both indifferently
for let the gods so speed me as i love
the name of honour more than i fear death


cassius

i know that virtue to be in you brutus
as well as i do know your outward favour
well honour is the subject of my story
i cannot tell what you and other men
think of this life but for my single self
i had as lief not be as live to be
in awe of such a thing as i myself
i was born free as caesar so were you
we both have fed as well and we can both
endure the winter cold as well as he
for once upon a raw and gusty day
the troubled tiber chafing with her shores
caesar said to me arest thou cassius now
leap in with me into this angry flood
and swim to yonder point upon the word
accoutred as i was i plunged in
and bade him follow so indeed he did
the torrent roar and we did buffet it
with lusty sinews throwing it aside
and stemming it with hearts of controversy
but ere we could arrive the point proposed
caesar cried help me cassius or i sink
i as aeneas our great ancestor
did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder
the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber
did i the tired caesar and this man
is now become a god and cassius is
a wretched creature and must bend his body
if caesar carelessly but nod on him
he had a fever when he was in spain
and when the fit was on him i did mark
how he did shake tis true this god did shake
his coward lips did from their colour fly
and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
did lose his lustre i did hear him groan
ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans
mark him and write his speeches in their books
alas it cried give me some drink titinius
as a sick girl ye gods it doth amaze me
a man of such a feeble temper should
so get the start of the majestic world
and bear the palm alone
shout flourish


brutus

another general shout
i do believe that these applauses are
for some new honours that are heap on caesar


cassius

why man he doth bestride the narrow world
like a colossus and we petty men
walk under his huge legs and peep about
to find ourselves dishonourable graves
men at some time are masters of their fates
the fault dear brutus is not in our stars
but in ourselves that we are underlings
brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar
why should that name be sounded more than yours
write them together yours is as fair a name
sound them it doth become the mouth as well
weigh them it is as heavy conjure with em
brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar
now in the names of all the gods at once
upon what meat doth this our caesar feed
that he is grown so great age thou art shamed
rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods
when went there by an age since the great flood
but it was famed with more than with one man
when could they say till now that talk of rome
that her wide walls encompass but one man
now is it rome indeed and room enough
when there is in it but one only man
o you and i have heard our fathers say
there was a brutus once that would have brook
the eternal devil to keep his state in rome
as easily as a king


brutus

that you do love me i am nothing jealous
what you would work me to i have some aim
how i have thought of this and of these times
i shall recount hereafter for this present
i would not so with love i might entreat you
be any further moved what you have said
i will consider what you have to say
i will with patience hear and find a time
both meet to hear and answer such high things
till then my noble friend chew upon this
brutus had rather be a villager
than to repute himself a son of rome
under these hard conditions as this time
is like to lay upon us


cassius

i am glad that my weak words
have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus


brutus

the games are done and caesar is returning


cassius

as they pass by pluck casca by the sleeve
and he will after his sour fashion tell you
what hath proceeded worthy note to-day
re-enter caesar and his train


brutus

i will do so but look you cassius
the angry spot doth glow on caesar brow
and all the rest look like a chidden train
calpurnia cheek is pale and cicero
looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
as we have seen him in the capitol
being cross in conference by some senators


cassius

casca will tell us what the matter is


caesar

antonius


antony

caesar


caesar

let me have men about me that are fat
sleek-headed men and such as sleep o nights
yond cassius has a lean and hungry look
he thinks too much such men are dangerous


antony

fear him not caesar he not dangerous
he is a noble roman and well given


caesar

would he were fatter but i fear him not
yet if my name were liable to fear
i do not know the man i should avoid
so soon as that spare cassius he reads much
he is a great observer and he looks
quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays
as thou dost antony he hears no music
seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort
as if he mock himself and scorn his spirit
that could be moved to smile at any thing
such men as he be never at heart ease
whiles they behold a greater than themselves
and therefore are they very dangerous
i rather tell thee what is to be fear
than what i fear for always i am caesar
come on my right hand for this ear is deaf
and tell me truly what thou think of him
sennet exeunt caesar and all his train but casca


casca

you pull me by the cloak would you speak with me


brutus

ay casca tell us what hath chanced to-day
that caesar looks so sad


casca

why you were with him were you not


brutus

i should not then ask casca what had chanced


casca

why there was a crown offered him and being
offered him he put it by with the back of his hand
thus and then the people fell a-shouting


brutus

what was the second noise for


casca

why for that too


cassius

they shouted thrice what was the last cry for


casca

why for that too


brutus

was the crown offered him thrice


casca

ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every
time gentler than other and at every putting-by
mine honest neighbours shouted


cassius

who offered him the crown


casca

why antony


brutus

tell us the manner of it gentle casca


casca

i can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it
it was mere foolery i did not mark it i saw mark
antony offer him a crown yet twas not a crown
neither twas one of these coronets and as i told
you he put it by once but for all that to my
thinking he would fain have had it then he
offered it to him again then he put it by again
but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his
fingers off it and then he offered it the third
time he put it the third time by and still as he
refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their
chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
caesar for he swounded and fell down at it and
for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of
opening my lips and receiving the bad air


cassius

but soft i pray you what did caesar swound


casca

he fell down in the market-place and foamed at
mouth and was speechless


brutus

tis very like he hath the failing sickness


cassius

no caesar hath it not but you and i
and honest casca we have the falling sickness


casca

i know not what you mean by that but i am sure
caesar fell down if the tag-rag people did not
clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and
displeased them as they use to do the players in
the theatre i am no true man


brutus

what said he when he came unto himself


casca

marry before he fell down when he perceived the
common herd was glad he refused the crown he
plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
throat to cut an i had been a man of any
occupation if i would not have taken him at a word
i would i might go to hell among the rogues and so
he fell when he came to himself again he said
if he had done or said any thing amiss he desired
their worships to think it was his infirmity three
or four wenches where i stood cried alas good
soul and forgave him with all their hearts but
there no heed to be taken of them if caesar had
stabbed their mothers they would have done no less


brutus

and after that he came thus sad away


casca

ay


cassius

did cicero say any thing


casca

ay he spoke greek


cassius

to what effect


casca

nay an i tell you that ill neer look you i the
face again but those that understood him smiled at
one another and shook their heads but for mine own
part it was greek to me i could tell you more
news too marullus and flavius for pulling scarfs
off caesar images are put to silence fare you
well there was more foolery yet if i could
remember it


cassius

will you sup with me to-night casca


casca

no i am promised forth


cassius

will you dine with me to-morrow


casca

ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
worth the eating


cassius

good i will expect you


casca

do so farewell both
exit


brutus

what a blunt fellow is this grown to be
he was quick mettle when he went to school


cassius

so is he now in execution
of any bold or noble enterprise
however he puts on this tardy form
this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit
which gives men stomach to digest his words
with better appetite


brutus

and so it is for this time i will leave you
to-morrow if you please to speak with me
i will come home to you or if you will
come home to me and i will wait for you


cassius

i will do so till then think of the world
exit brutus
well brutus thou art noble yet i see
thy honourable metal may be wrought
from that it is disposed therefore it is meet
that noble minds keep ever with their likes
for who so firm that cannot be seduced
caesar doth bear me hard but he loves brutus
if i were brutus now and he were cassius
he should not humour me i will this night
in several hands in at his windows throw
as if they came from several citizens
writings all tending to the great opinion
that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely
caesar ambition shall be glanced at
and after this let caesar seat him sure
for we will shake him or worse days endure
exit

scene iii the same a street

thunder and lightning enter from opposite sides casca with his sword drawn and cicero


cicero

good even casca brought you caesar home
why are you breathless and why stare you so


casca

are not you moved when all the sway of earth
shakes like a thing unfirm o cicero
i have seen tempests when the scolding winds
have rived the knotty oaks and i have seen
the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
to be exalted with the threatening clouds
but never till to-night never till now
did i go through a tempest dropping fire
either there is a civil strife in heaven
or else the world too saucy with the gods
incenses them to send destruction


cicero

why saw you any thing more wonderful


casca

a common slave you know him well by sight 
held up his left hand which did flame and burn
like twenty torches join and yet his hand
not sensible of fire remain unscorch
besides i ha not since put up my sword 
against the capitol i met a lion
who glared upon me and went surly by
without annoying me and there were drawn
upon a heap a hundred ghastly women
transformed with their fear who swore they saw
men all in fire walk up and down the streets
and yesterday the bird of night did sit
even at noon-day upon the market-place
hooting and shrieking when these prodigies
do so conjointly meet let not men say
these are their reasons they are natural
for i believe they are portentous things
unto the climate that they point upon


cicero

indeed it is a strange-disposed time
but men may construe things after their fashion
clean from the purpose of the things themselves
come caesar to the capitol to-morrow


casca

he doth for he did bid antonius
send word to you he would be there to-morrow


cicero

good night then casca this disturbed sky
is not to walk in


casca

farewell cicero
exit cicero
enter cassius


cassius

who there


casca

a roman


cassius

casca by your voice


casca

your ear is good cassius what night is this


cassius

a very pleasing night to honest men


casca

who ever knew the heavens menace so


cassius

those that have known the earth so full of faults
for my part i have walk about the streets
submitting me unto the perilous night
and thus unbraced casca as you see
have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone
and when the cross blue lightning seem to open
the breast of heaven i did present myself
even in the aim and very flash of it


casca

but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
it is the part of men to fear and tremble
when the most mighty gods by tokens send
such dreadful heralds to astonish us


cassius

you are dull casca and those sparks of life
that should be in a roman you do want
or else you use not you look pale and gaze
and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
to see the strange impatience of the heavens
but if you would consider the true cause
why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts
why birds and beasts from quality and kind
why old men fool and children calculate
why all these things change from their ordinance
their natures and preformed faculties
to monstrous quality why you shall find
that heaven hath infused them with these spirits
to make them instruments of fear and warning
unto some monstrous state
now could i casca name to thee a man
most like this dreadful night
that thunders lightens opens graves and roars
as doth the lion in the capitol
a man no mightier than thyself or me
in personal action yet prodigious grown
and fearful as these strange eruptions are


casca

tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius


cassius

let it be who it is for romans now
have thews and limbs like to their ancestors
but woe the while our fathers minds are dead
and we are govern with our mothers spirits
our yoke and sufferance show us womanish


casca

indeed they say the senators tomorrow
mean to establish caesar as a king
and he shall wear his crown by sea and land
in every place save here in italy


cassius

i know where i will wear this dagger then
cassius from bondage will deliver cassius
therein ye gods you make the weak most strong
therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat
nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass
nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron
can be retentive to the strength of spirit
but life being weary of these worldly bars
never lacks power to dismiss itself
if i know this know all the world besides
that part of tyranny that i do bear
i can shake off at pleasure
thunder still


casca

so can i
so every bondman in his own hand bears
the power to cancel his captivity


cassius

and why should caesar be a tyrant then
poor man i know he would not be a wolf
but that he sees the romans are but sheep
he were no lion were not romans hinds
those that with haste will make a mighty fire
begin it with weak straws what trash is rome
what rubbish and what offal when it serves
for the base matter to illuminate
so vile a thing as caesar but o grief
where hast thou led me i perhaps speak this
before a willing bondman then i know
my answer must be made but i am arm
and dangers are to me indifferent


casca

you speak to casca and to such a man
that is no fleering tell-tale hold my hand
be factious for redress of all these griefs
and i will set this foot of mine as far
as who goes farthest


cassius

there a bargain made
now know you casca i have moved already
some certain of the noblest-minded romans
to undergo with me an enterprise
of honourable-dangerous consequence
and i do know by this they stay for me
in pompey porch for now this fearful night
there is no stir or walking in the streets
and the complexion of the element
in favour like the work we have in hand
most bloody fiery and most terrible


casca

stand close awhile for here comes one in haste


cassius

tis cinna i do know him by his gait
he is a friend
enter cinna
cinna where haste you so


cinna

to find out you who that metellus cimber


cassius

no it is casca one incorporate
to our attempts am i not stay for cinna


cinna

i am glad on t what a fearful night is this
there two or three of us have seen strange sights


cassius

am i not stay for tell me


cinna

yes you are
o cassius if you could
but win the noble brutus to our party 


cassius

be you content good cinna take this paper
and look you lay it in the praetor chair
where brutus may but find it and throw this
in at his window set this up with wax
upon old brutus statue all this done
repair to pompey porch where you shall find us
is decius brutus and trebonius there


cinna

all but metellus cimber and he gone
to seek you at your house well i will hie
and so bestow these papers as you bade me


cassius

that done repair to pompey theatre
exit cinna
come casca you and i will yet ere day
see brutus at his house three parts of him
is ours already and the man entire
upon the next encounter yields him ours


casca

o he sits high in all the people hearts
and that which would appear offence in us
his countenance like richest alchemy
will change to virtue and to worthiness


cassius

him and his worth and our great need of him
you have right well conceited let us go
for it is after midnight and ere day
we will awake him and be sure of him

act ii
scene i rome brutus orchard

enter brutus


brutus

what lucius ho
i cannot by the progress of the stars
give guess how near to day lucius i say
i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly
when lucius when awake i say what lucius
enter lucius


lucius

call you my lord


brutus

get me a taper in my study lucius
when it is lighted come and call me here


lucius

i will my lord
exit


brutus

it must be by his death and for my part
i know no personal cause to spurn at him
but for the general he would be crown
how that might change his nature there the question
it is the bright day that brings forth the adder
and that craves wary walking crown him that 
and then i grant we put a sting in him
that at his will he may do danger with
the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar
i have not known when his affections sway
more than his reason but tis a common proof
that lowliness is young ambition ladder
whereto the climber-upward turns his face
but when he once attains the upmost round
he then unto the ladder turns his back
looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees
by which he did ascend so caesar may
then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel
will bear no colour for the thing he is
fashion it thus that what he is augmented
would run to these and these extremities
and therefore think him as a serpent egg
which hatch would as his kind grow mischievous
and kill him in the shell
re-enter lucius


lucius

the taper burneth in your closet sir
searching the window for a flint i found
this paper thus seal up and i am sure
it did not lie there when i went to bed
gives him the letter


brutus

get you to bed again it is not day
is not to-morrow boy the ides of march


lucius

i know not sir


brutus

look in the calendar and bring me word


lucius

i will sir
exit


brutus

the exhalations whizzing in the air
give so much light that i may read by them
opens the letter and reads
brutus thou sleep awake and see thyself
shall rome   c speak strike redress
brutus thou sleep awake
such instigations have been often dropp
where i have took them up
hall rome   c thus must i piece it out
shall rome stand under one man awe what rome
my ancestors did from the streets of rome
the tarquin drive when he was call a king
peak strike redress am i entreated
to speak and strike o rome i make thee promise
if the redress will follow thou receivest
thy full petition at the hand of brutus
re-enter lucius


lucius

sir march is wasted fourteen days
knocking within


brutus

tis good go to the gate somebody knocks
exit lucius
since cassius first did whet me against caesar
i have not slept
between the acting of a dreadful thing
and the first motion all the interim is
like a phantasma or a hideous dream
the genius and the mortal instruments
are then in council and the state of man
like to a little kingdom suffers then
the nature of an insurrection
re-enter lucius


lucius

sir tis your brother cassius at the door
who doth desire to see you


brutus

is he alone


lucius

no sir there are moe with him


brutus

do you know them


lucius

no sir their hats are pluck about their ears
and half their faces buried in their cloaks
that by no means i may discover them
by any mark of favour


brutus

let em enter
exit lucius
they are the faction o conspiracy
shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night
when evils are most free o then by day
where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy
hide it in smiles and affability
for if thou path thy native semblance on
not erebus itself were dim enough
to hide thee from prevention
enter the conspirators cassius casca decius brutus cinna metellus cimber and trebonius


cassius

i think we are too bold upon your rest
good morrow brutus do we trouble you


brutus

i have been up this hour awake all night
know i these men that come along with you


cassius

yes every man of them and no man here
but honours you and every one doth wish
you had but that opinion of yourself
which every noble roman bears of you
this is trebonius


brutus

he is welcome hither


cassius

this decius brutus


brutus

he is welcome too


cassius

this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber


brutus

they are all welcome
what watchful cares do interpose themselves
betwixt your eyes and night


cassius

shall i entreat a word
brutus and cassius whisper


decius brutus

here lies the east doth not the day break here


casca

no


cinna

o pardon sir it doth and yon gray lines
that fret the clouds are messengers of day


casca

you shall confess that you are both deceived
here as i point my sword the sun arises
which is a great way growing on the south
weighing the youthful season of the year
some two months hence up higher toward the north
he first presents his fire and the high east
stands as the capitol directly here


brutus

give me your hands all over one by one


cassius

and let us swear our resolution


brutus

no not an oath if not the face of men
the sufferance of our souls the time abuse 
if these be motives weak break off betimes
and every man hence to his idle bed
so let high-sighted tyranny range on
till each man drop by lottery but if these
as i am sure they do bear fire enough
to kindle cowards and to steel with valour
the melting spirits of women then countrymen
what need we any spur but our own cause
to prick us to redress what other bond
than secret romans that have spoke the word
and will not palter and what other oath
than honesty to honesty engaged
that this shall be or we will fall for it
swear priests and cowards and men cautelous
old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear
such creatures as men doubt but do not stain
the even virtue of our enterprise
nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits
to think that or our cause or our performance
did need an oath when every drop of blood
that every roman bears and nobly bears
is guilty of a several bastardy
if he do break the smallest particle
of any promise that hath pass from him


cassius

but what of cicero shall we sound him
i think he will stand very strong with us


casca

let us not leave him out


cinna

no by no means


metellus cimber

o let us have him for his silver hairs
will purchase us a good opinion
and buy men voices to commend our deeds
it shall be said his judgment ruled our hands
our youths and wildness shall no whit appear
but all be buried in his gravity


brutus

o name him not let us not break with him
for he will never follow any thing
that other men begin


cassius

then leave him out


casca

indeed he is not fit


decius brutus

shall no man else be touch but only caesar


cassius

decius well urged i think it is not meet
mark antony so well beloved of caesar
should outlive caesar we shall find of him
a shrewd contriver and you know his means
if he improve them may well stretch so far
as to annoy us all which to prevent
let antony and caesar fall together


brutus

our course will seem too bloody caius cassius
to cut the head off and then hack the limbs
like wrath in death and envy afterwards
for antony is but a limb of caesar
let us be sacrificers but not butchers caius
we all stand up against the spirit of caesar
and in the spirit of men there is no blood
o that we then could come by caesar spirit
and not dismember caesar but alas
caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends
let kill him boldly but not wrathfully
let carve him as a dish fit for the gods
not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds
and let our hearts as subtle masters do
stir up their servants to an act of rage
and after seem to chide em this shall make
our purpose necessary and not envious
which so appearing to the common eyes
we shall be call purgers not murderers
and for mark antony think not of him
for he can do no more than caesar arm
when caesar head is off


cassius

yet i fear him
for in the ingrafted love he bears to caesar 


brutus

alas good cassius do not think of him
if he love caesar all that he can do
is to himself take thought and die for caesar
and that were much he should for he is given
to sports to wildness and much company


trebonius

there is no fear in him let him not die
for he will live and laugh at this hereafter
clock strikes


brutus

peace count the clock


cassius

the clock hath stricken three


trebonius

tis time to part


cassius

but it is doubtful yet
whether caesar will come forth to-day or no
for he is superstitious grown of late
quite from the main opinion he held once
of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies
it may be these apparent prodigies
the unaccustom terror of this night
and the persuasion of his augurers
may hold him from the capitol to-day


decius brutus

never fear that if he be so resolved
i can oersway him for he loves to hear
that unicorns may be betray with trees
and bears with glasses elephants with holes
lions with toils and men with flatterers
but when i tell him he hates flatterers
he says he does being then most flattered
let me work
for i can give his humour the true bent
and i will bring him to the capitol


cassius

nay we will all of us be there to fetch him


brutus

by the eighth hour is that the uttermost


cinna

be that the uttermost and fail not then


metellus cimber

caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard
who rated him for speaking well of pompey
i wonder none of you have thought of him


brutus

now good metellus go along by him
he loves me well and i have given him reasons
send him but hither and ill fashion him


cassius

the morning comes upon  well leave you brutus
and friends disperse yourselves but all remember
what you have said and show yourselves true romans


brutus

good gentlemen look fresh and merrily
let not our looks put on our purposes
but bear it as our roman actors do
with untired spirits and formal constancy
and so good morrow to you every one
exeunt all but brutus
boy lucius fast asleep it is no matter
enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber
thou hast no figures nor no fantasies
which busy care draws in the brains of men
therefore thou sleep so sound
enter portia


portia

brutus my lord


brutus

portia what mean you wherefore rise you now
it is not for your health thus to commit
your weak condition to the raw cold morning


portia

nor for yours neither youve ungently brutus
stole from my bed and yesternight at supper
you suddenly arose and walk about
musing and sighing with your arms across
and when i ask you what the matter was
you stared upon me with ungentle looks
i urged you further then you scratch your head
and too impatiently stamp with your foot
yet i insisted yet you answer not
but with an angry wafture of your hand
gave sign for me to leave you so i did
fearing to strengthen that impatience
which seem too much enkindled and withal
hoping it was but an effect of humour
which sometime hath his hour with every man
it will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep
and could it work so much upon your shape
as it hath much prevail on your condition
i should not know you brutus dear my lord
make me acquainted with your cause of grief


brutus

i am not well in health and that is all


portia

brutus is wise and were he not in health
he would embrace the means to come by it


brutus

why so i do good portia go to bed


portia

is brutus sick and is it physical
to walk unbraced and suck up the humours
of the dank morning what is brutus sick
and will he steal out of his wholesome bed
to dare the vile contagion of the night
and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
to add unto his sickness no my brutus
you have some sick offence within your mind
which by the right and virtue of my place
i ought to know of and upon my knees
i charm you by my once-commended beauty
by all your vows of love and that great vow
which did incorporate and make us one
that you unfold to me yourself your half
why you are heavy and what men to-night
have had to resort to you for here have been
some six or seven who did hide their faces
even from darkness


brutus

kneel not gentle portia


portia

i should not need if you were gentle brutus
within the bond of marriage tell me brutus
is it excepted i should know no secrets
that appertain to you am i yourself
but as it were in sort or limitation
to keep with you at meals comfort your bed
and talk to you sometimes dwell i but in the suburbs
of your good pleasure if it be no more
portia is brutus harlot not his wife


brutus

you are my true and honourable wife
as dear to me as are the ruddy drops
that visit my sad heart


portia

if this were true then should i know this secret
i grant i am a woman but withal
a woman that lord brutus took to wife
i grant i am a woman but withal
a woman well-reputed cato daughter
think you i am no stronger than my sex
being so father and so husbanded
tell me your counsels i will not disclose em
i have made strong proof of my constancy
giving myself a voluntary wound
here in the thigh can i bear that with patience
and not my husband secrets


brutus

o ye gods
render me worthy of this noble wife
knocking within
hark hark one knocks portia go in awhile
and by and by thy bosom shall partake
the secrets of my heart
all my engagements i will construe to thee
all the charactery of my sad brows
leave me with haste
exit portia
lucius who that knocks
re-enter lucius with ligarius


lucius

he is a sick man that would speak with you


brutus

caius ligarius that metellus spake of
boy stand aside caius ligarius how


ligarius

vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue


brutus

o what a time have you chose out brave caius
to wear a kerchief would you were not sick


ligarius

i am not sick if brutus have in hand
any exploit worthy the name of honour


brutus

such an exploit have i in hand ligarius
had you a healthful ear to hear of it


ligarius

by all the gods that romans bow before
i here discard my sickness soul of rome
brave son derived from honourable loins
thou like an exorcist hast conjured up
my mortified spirit now bid me run
and i will strive with things impossible
yea get the better of them what to do


brutus

a piece of work that will make sick men whole


ligarius

but are not some whole that we must make sick


brutus

that must we also what it is my caius
i shall unfold to thee as we are going
to whom it must be done


ligarius

set on your foot
and with a heart new-fired i follow you
to do i know not what but it sufficeth
that brutus leads me on


brutus

follow me then
exeunt

scene ii caesar house

thunder and lightning enter caesar in his night-gown


caesar

nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night
thrice hath calpurnia in her sleep cried out
help ho they murder caesar who within
enter a servant


servant

my lord


caesar

go bid the priests do present sacrifice
and bring me their opinions of success


servant

i will my lord
exit
enter calpurnia


calpurnia

what mean you caesar think you to walk forth
you shall not stir out of your house to-day


caesar

caesar shall forth the things that threaten me
neer look but on my back when they shall see
the face of caesar they are vanished


calpurnia

caesar i never stood on ceremonies
yet now they fright me there is one within
besides the things that we have heard and seen
recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
a lioness hath whelped in the streets
and graves have yawn and yielded up their dead
fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds
in ranks and squadrons and right form of war
which drizzled blood upon the capitol
the noise of battle hurtled in the air
horses did neigh and dying men did groan
and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets
o caesar these things are beyond all use
and i do fear them


caesar

what can be avoided
whose end is purposed by the mighty gods
yet caesar shall go forth for these predictions
are to the world in general as to caesar


calpurnia

when beggars die there are no comets seen
the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes


caesar

cowards die many times before their deaths
the valiant never taste of death but once
of all the wonders that i yet have heard
it seems to me most strange that men should fear
seeing that death a necessary end
will come when it will come
re-enter servant
what say the augurers


servant

they would not have you to stir forth to-day
plucking the entrails of an offering forth
they could not find a heart within the beast


caesar

the gods do this in shame of cowardice
caesar should be a beast without a heart
if he should stay at home to-day for fear
no caesar shall not danger knows full well
that caesar is more dangerous than he
we are two lions litter in one day
and i the elder and more terrible
and caesar shall go forth


calpurnia

alas my lord
your wisdom is consumed in confidence
do not go forth to-day call it my fear
that keeps you in the house and not your own
well send mark antony to the senate-house
and he shall say you are not well to-day
let me upon my knee prevail in this


caesar

mark antony shall say i am not well
and for thy humour i will stay at home
enter decius brutus
here decius brutus he shall tell them so


decius brutus

caesar all hail good morrow worthy caesar
i come to fetch you to the senate-house


caesar

and you are come in very happy time
to bear my greeting to the senators
and tell them that i will not come to-day
cannot is false and that i dare not falser
i will not come to-day tell them so decius


calpurnia

say he is sick


caesar

shall caesar send a lie
have i in conquest stretch mine arm so far
to be afraid to tell graybeards the truth
decius go tell them caesar will not come


decius brutus

most mighty caesar let me know some cause
lest i be laugh at when i tell them so


caesar

the cause is in my will i will not come
that is enough to satisfy the senate
but for your private satisfaction
because i love you i will let you know
calpurnia here my wife stays me at home
she dreamt to-night she saw my statua
which like a fountain with an hundred spouts
did run pure blood and many lusty romans
came smiling and did bathe their hands in it
and these does she apply for warnings and portents
and evils imminent and on her knee
hath begg that i will stay at home to-day


decius brutus

this dream is all amiss interpreted
it was a vision fair and fortunate
your statue spouting blood in many pipes
in which so many smiling romans bathed
signifies that from you great rome shall suck
reviving blood and that great men shall press
for tinctures stains relics and cognizance
this by calpurnia dream is signified


caesar

and this way have you well expounded it


decius brutus

i have when you have heard what i can say
and know it now the senate have concluded
to give this day a crown to mighty caesar
if you shall send them word you will not come
their minds may change besides it were a mock
apt to be render for some one to say
break up the senate till another time
when caesar wife shall meet with better dreams
if caesar hide himself shall they not whisper
lo caesar is afraid
pardon me caesar for my dear dear love
to our proceeding bids me tell you this
and reason to my love is liable


caesar

how foolish do your fears seem now calpurnia
i am ashamed i did yield to them
give me my robe for i will go
enter publius brutus ligarius metellus casca trebonius and cinna
and look where publius is come to fetch me


publius

good morrow caesar


caesar

artemidorus

caesar beware of brutus take heed of cassius
come not near casca have an eye to cinna trust not
trebonius mark well metellus cimber decius brutus

there is but one mind in all these men and it is
bent against caesar if thou beest not immortal
look about you security gives way to conspiracy
the mighty gods defend thee thy lover
artemidorus
here will i stand till caesar pass along
and as a suitor will i give him this
my heart laments that virtue cannot live
out of the teeth of emulation
if thou read this o caesar thou mayst live
if not the fates with traitors do contrive

portia

exeunt severally

act iii
scene i rome before the capitol the senate sitting above

a crowd of people among them artemidorus and the  soothsayer flourish enter caesar brutus  cassius casca decius brutus metellus cimber  trebonius cinna antony lepidus popilius publius and others


caesar

caesar goes up to the senate-house the rest following


popilius

cassius

what enterprise popilius


popilius

fare you well
advances to caesar


brutus

what said popilius lena


cassius

he wish to-day our enterprise might thrive
i fear our purpose is discovered


brutus

look how he makes to caesar mark him


cassius

casca be sudden for we fear prevention
brutus what shall be done if this be known
cassius or caesar never shall turn back
for i will slay myself


brutus

cassius be constant
popilius lena speaks not of our purposes
for look he smiles and caesar doth not change


cassius

trebonius knows his time for look you brutus
he draws mark antony out of the way
exeunt antony and trebonius


decius brutus

where is metellus cimber let him go
and presently prefer his suit to caesar


brutus

he is address press near and second him


cinna

casca you are the first that rears your hand


caesar

are we all ready what is now amiss
that caesar and his senate must redress


metellus cimber

most high most mighty and most puissant caesar
metellus cimber throws before thy seat
an humble heart 
kneeling


caesar

i must prevent thee cimber
these couchings and these lowly courtesies
might fire the blood of ordinary men
and turn pre-ordinance and first decree
into the law of children be not fond
to think that caesar bears such rebel blood
that will be thaw from the true quality
with that which melteth fools i mean sweet words
low-crooked courties and base spaniel-fawning
thy brother by decree is banished
if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him
i spurn thee like a cur out of my way
know caesar doth not wrong nor without cause
will he be satisfied


metellus cimber

is there no voice more worthy than my own
to sound more sweetly in great caesar ear
for the repealing of my banish brother


brutus

i kiss thy hand but not in flattery caesar
desiring thee that publius cimber may
have an immediate freedom of repeal


caesar

what brutus


cassius

pardon caesar caesar pardon
as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall
to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber


cassius

i could be well moved if i were as you
if i could pray to move prayers would move me
but i am constant as the northern star
of whose true-fix and resting quality
there is no fellow in the firmament
the skies are painted with unnumber sparks
they are all fire and every one doth shine
but there but one in all doth hold his place
so in the world tis furnish well with men
and men are flesh and blood and apprehensive
yet in the number i do know but one
that unassailable holds on his rank
unshaked of motion and that i am he
let me a little show it even in this
that i was constant cimber should be banish
and constant do remain to keep him so


cinna

o caesar 


caesar

hence wilt thou lift up olympus


decius brutus

great caesar 


caesar

doth not brutus bootless kneel


casca

speak hands for me
casca first then the other conspirators and brutus stab caesar


caesar

et tu brute then fall caesar
dies


cinna

liberty freedom tyranny is dead
run hence proclaim cry it about the streets


cassius

some to the common pulpits and cry out
liberty freedom and enfranchisement


brutus

people and senators be not affrighted
fly not stand stiff ambition debt is paid


casca

go to the pulpit brutus


decius brutus

and cassius too


brutus

where publius


cinna

here quite confounded with this mutiny


metellus cimber

stand fast together lest some friend of caesar
should chance 


brutus

talk not of standing publius good cheer
there is no harm intended to your person
nor to no roman else so tell them publius


cassius

and leave us publius lest that the people
rushing on us should do your age some mischief


brutus

do so and let no man abide this deed
but we the doers
re-enter trebonius


cassius

where is antony


trebonius

fled to his house amazed
men wives and children stare cry out and run
as it were doomsday


brutus

fates we will know your pleasures
that we shall die we know tis but the time
and drawing days out that men stand upon


cassius

why he that cuts off twenty years of life
cuts off so many years of fearing death


brutus

grant that and then is death a benefit
so are we caesar friends that have abridged
his time of fearing death stoop romans stoop
and let us bathe our hands in caesar blood
up to the elbows and besmear our swords
then walk we forth even to the market-place
and waving our red weapons oer our heads
let all cry peace freedom and liberty


cassius

stoop then and wash how many ages hence
shall this our lofty scene be acted over
in states unborn and accents yet unknown


brutus

how many times shall caesar bleed in sport
that now on pompey basis lies along
no worthier than the dust


cassius

so oft as that shall be
so often shall the knot of us be call
the men that gave their country liberty


decius brutus

what shall we forth


cassius

ay every man away
brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels
with the most boldest and best hearts of rome
enter a servant


brutus

soft who comes here a friend of antony


servant

thus brutus did my master bid me kneel
thus did mark antony bid me fall down
and being prostrate thus he bade me say
brutus is noble wise valiant and honest
caesar was mighty bold royal and loving
say i love brutus and i honour him
say i fear caesar honour him and loved him
if brutus will vouchsafe that antony
may safely come to him and be resolved
how caesar hath deserved to lie in death
mark antony shall not love caesar dead
so well as brutus living but will follow
the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus
thorough the hazards of this untrod state
with all true faith so says my master antony


brutus

thy master is a wise and valiant roman
i never thought him worse
tell him so please him come unto this place
he shall be satisfied and by my honour
depart untouch


servant

ill fetch him presently
exit


brutus

i know that we shall have him well to friend


cassius

i wish we may but yet have i a mind
that fears him much and my misgiving still
falls shrewdly to the purpose


brutus

but here comes antony
re-enter antony
welcome mark antony


antony

o mighty caesar dost thou lie so low
are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils
shrunk to this little measure fare thee well
i know not gentlemen what you intend
who else must be let blood who else is rank
if i myself there is no hour so fit
as caesar death hour nor no instrument
of half that worth as those your swords made rich
with the most noble blood of all this world
i do beseech ye if you bear me hard
now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke
fulfil your pleasure live a thousand years
i shall not find myself so apt to die
no place will please me so no mean of death
as here by caesar and by you cut off
the choice and master spirits of this age


brutus

o antony beg not your death of us
though now we must appear bloody and cruel
as by our hands and this our present act
you see we do yet see you but our hands
and this the bleeding business they have done
our hearts you see not they are pitiful
and pity to the general wrong of rome 
as fire drives out fire so pity pity 
hath done this deed on caesar for your part
to you our swords have leaden points mark antony
our arms in strength of malice and our hearts
of brothers temper do receive you in
with all kind love good thoughts and reverence


cassius

your voice shall be as strong as any man
in the disposing of new dignities


brutus

only be patient till we have appeased
the multitude beside themselves with fear
and then we will deliver you the cause
why i that did love caesar when i struck him
have thus proceeded


antony

i doubt not of your wisdom
let each man render me his bloody hand
first marcus brutus will i shake with you
next caius cassius do i take your hand
now decius brutus yours now yours metellus
yours cinna and my valiant casca yours
though last not last in love yours good trebonius
gentlemen all alas what shall i say
my credit now stands on such slippery ground
that one of two bad ways you must conceit me
either a coward or a flatterer
that i did love thee caesar o tis true
if then thy spirit look upon us now
shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
to see thy thy anthony making his peace
shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes
most noble in the presence of thy corse
had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds
weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood
it would become me better than to close
in terms of friendship with thine enemies
pardon me julius here wast thou bay brave hart
here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand
sign in thy spoil and crimson in thy lethe
o world thou wast the forest to this hart
and this indeed o world the heart of thee
how like a deer strucken by many princes
dost thou here lie


cassius

mark antony 


antony

pardon me caius cassius
the enemies of caesar shall say this
then in a friend it is cold modesty


cassius

i blame you not for praising caesar so
but what compact mean you to have with us
will you be prick in number of our friends
or shall we on and not depend on you


antony

therefore i took your hands but was indeed
sway from the point by looking down on caesar
friends am i with you all and love you all
upon this hope that you shall give me reasons
why and wherein caesar was dangerous


brutus

or else were this a savage spectacle
our reasons are so full of good regard
that were you antony the son of caesar
you should be satisfied


antony

that all i seek
and am moreover suitor that i may
produce his body to the market-place
and in the pulpit as becomes a friend
speak in the order of his funeral


brutus

you shall mark antony


cassius

brutus a word with you
aside to brutus
you know not what you do do not consent
that antony speak in his funeral
know you how much the people may be moved
by that which he will utter


brutus

by your pardon
i will myself into the pulpit first
and show the reason of our caesar death
what antony shall speak i will protest
he speaks by leave and by permission
and that we are contented caesar shall
have all true rites and lawful ceremonies
it shall advantage more than do us wrong


cassius

i know not what may fall i like it not


brutus

mark antony here take you caesar body
you shall not in your funeral speech blame us
but speak all good you can devise of caesar
and say you dot by our permission
else shall you not have any hand at all
about his funeral and you shall speak
in the same pulpit whereto i am going
after my speech is ended


antony

be it so
i do desire no more


brutus

prepare the body then and follow us
exeunt all but antony


antony

o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
that i am meek and gentle with these butchers
thou art the ruins of the noblest man
that ever lived in the tide of times
woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
over thy wounds now do i prophesy 
which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue 
a curse shall light upon the limbs of men
domestic fury and fierce civil strife
shall cumber all the parts of italy
blood and destruction shall be so in use
and dreadful objects so familiar
that mothers shall but smile when they behold
their infants quarter with the hands of war
all pity choked with custom of fell deeds
and caesar spirit ranging for revenge
with ate by his side come hot from hell
shall in these confines with a monarch voice
cry  havoc and let slip the dogs of war
that this foul deed shall smell above the earth
with carrion men groaning for burial
enter a servant
you serve octavius caesar do you not


servant

i do mark antony


antony

caesar did write for him to come to rome


servant

he did receive his letters and is coming
and bid me say to you by word of mouth 
o caesar 
seeing the body


antony

thy heart is big get thee apart and weep
passion i see is catching for mine eyes
seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine
began to water is thy master coming


servant

he lies to-night within seven leagues of rome


antony

post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced
here is a mourning rome a dangerous rome
no rome of safety for octavius yet
hie hence and tell him so yet stay awhile
thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse
into the market-place there shall i try
in my oration how the people take
the cruel issue of these bloody men
according to the which thou shalt discourse
to young octavius of the state of things
lend me your hand
exeunt with caesar body

scene ii the forum

enter brutus and cassius and a throng of citizens


citizens

we will be satisfied let us be satisfied


brutus

then follow me and give me audience friends
cassius go you into the other street
and part the numbers
those that will hear me speak let em stay here
those that will follow cassius go with him
and public reasons shall be rendered
of caesar death


first citizen

second citizen

brutus

be patient till the last
romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my
cause and be silent that you may hear believe me
for mine honour and have respect to mine honour that
you may believe censure me in your wisdom and
awake your senses that you may the better judge
if there be any in this assembly any dear friend of
caesar to him i say that brutus love to caesar
was no less than his if then that friend demand
why brutus rose against caesar this is my answer
 not that i loved caesar less but that i loved
rome more had you rather caesar were living and
die all slaves than that caesar were dead to live
all free men as caesar loved me i weep for him
as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was
valiant i honour him but as he was ambitious i
slew him there is tears for his love joy for his
fortune honour for his valour and death for his
ambition who is here so base that would be a
bondman if any speak for him have i offended
who is here so rude that would not be a roman if
any speak for him have i offended who is here so
vile that will not love his country if any speak
for him have i offended i pause for a reply


all

none brutus none


brutus

then none have i offended i have done no more to
caesar than you shall do to brutus the question of
his death is enrolled in the capitol his glory not
extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences
enforced for which he suffered death
enter antony and others with caesar body
here comes his body mourned by mark antony who
though he had no hand in his death shall receive
the benefit of his dying a place in the
commonwealth as which of you shall not with this
i depart that as i slew my best lover for the
good of rome i have the same dagger for myself
when it shall please my country to need my death

third citizen

nay that certain
we are blest that rome is rid of him


second citizen

peace let us hear what antony can say


antony

you gentle romans 


citizens

peace ho let us hear him


antony

friends romans countrymen lend me your ears
i come to bury caesar not to praise him
the evil that men do lives after them
the good is oft interred with their bones
so let it be with caesar the noble brutus
hath told you caesar was ambitious
if it were so it was a grievous fault
and grievously hath caesar answer it
here under leave of brutus and the rest 
for brutus is an honourable man
so are they all all honourable men 
come i to speak in caesar funeral
he was my friend faithful and just to me
but brutus says he was ambitious
and brutus is an honourable man
he hath brought many captives home to rome
whose ransoms did the general coffers fill
did this in caesar seem ambitious
when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept
ambition should be made of sterner stuff
yet brutus says he was ambitious
and brutus is an honourable man
you all did see that on the lupercal
i thrice presented him a kingly crown
which he did thrice refuse was this ambition
yet brutus says he was ambitious
and sure he is an honourable man
i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke
but here i am to speak what i do know
you all did love him once not without cause
what cause withholds you then to mourn for him
o judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts
and men have lost their reason bear with me
my heart is in the coffin there with caesar
and i must pause till it come back to me


first citizen

methinks there is much reason in his sayings


second citizen

if thou consider rightly of the matter
caesar has had great wrong


third citizen

has he masters
i fear there will a worse come in his place


fourth citizen

mark ye his words he would not take the crown
therefore tis certain he was not ambitious


first citizen

if it be found so some will dear abide it


second citizen

poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping


third citizen

there not a nobler man in rome than antony


fourth citizen

now mark him he begins again to speak


antony

but yesterday the word of caesar might
have stood against the world now lies he there
and none so poor to do him reverence
o masters if i were disposed to stir
your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage
i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong
who you all know are honourable men
i will not do them wrong i rather choose
to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you
than i will wrong such honourable men
but here a parchment with the seal of caesar
i found it in his closet tis his will
let but the commons hear this testament 
which pardon me i do not mean to read 
and they would go and kiss dead caesar wounds
and dip their napkins in his sacred blood
yea beg a hair of him for memory
and dying mention it within their wills
bequeathing it as a rich legacy
unto their issue


fourth citizen

well hear the will read it mark antony


all

the will the will we will hear caesar will


antony

have patience gentle friends i must not read it
it is not meet you know how caesar loved you
you are not wood you are not stones but men
and being men bearing the will of caesar
it will inflame you it will make you mad
tis good you know not that you are his heirs
for if you should o what would come of it


fourth citizen

read the will well hear it antony
you shall read us the will caesar will


antony

will you be patient will you stay awhile
i have oershot myself to tell you of it
i fear i wrong the honourable men
whose daggers have stabb caesar i do fear it


fourth citizen

they were traitors honourable men


all

the will the testament


second citizen

they were villains murderers the will read the will


antony

you will compel me then to read the will
then make a ring about the corpse of caesar
and let me show you him that made the will
shall i descend and will you give me leave


several citizens

several citizens

antony

if you have tears prepare to shed them now
you all do know this mantle i remember
the first time ever caesar put it on
twas on a summer evening in his tent
that day he overcame the nervii
look in this place ran cassius dagger through
see what a rent the envious casca made
through this the well-beloved brutus stabb
and as he pluck his cursed steel away
mark how the blood of caesar follow it
as rushing out of doors to be resolved
if brutus so unkindly knock or no
for brutus as you know was caesar angel
judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him
this was the most unkindest cut of all
for when the noble caesar saw him stab
ingratitude more strong than traitors arms
quite vanquish him then burst his mighty heart
and in his mantle muffling up his face
even at the base of pompey statua
which all the while ran blood great caesar fell
o what a fall was there my countrymen
then i and you and all of us fell down
whilst bloody treason flourish over us
o now you weep and i perceive you feel
the dint of pity these are gracious drops
kind souls what weep you when you but behold
our caesar vesture wounded look you here
here is himself marr as you see with traitors


first citizen

o piteous spectacle

antony

good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up
to such a sudden flood of mutiny
they that have done this deed are honourable
what private griefs they have alas i know not
that made them do it they are wise and honourable
and will no doubt with reasons answer you
i come not friends to steal away your hearts
i am no orator as brutus is
but as you know me all a plain blunt man
that love my friend and that they know full well
that gave me public leave to speak of him
for i have neither wit nor words nor worth
action nor utterance nor the power of speech
to stir men blood i only speak right on
i tell you that which you yourselves do know
show you sweet caesar wounds poor poor dumb mouths
and bid them speak for me but were i brutus
and brutus antony there were an antony
would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
in every wound of caesar that should move
the stones of rome to rise and mutiny


all

how to cut off some charge in legacies


lepidus

what shall i find you here


octavius

or here or at the capitol
exit lepidus


antony

this is a slight unmeritable man
meet to be sent on errands is it fit
the three-fold world divided he should stand
one of the three to share it


octavius

so you thought him
and took his voice who should be prick to die
in our black sentence and proscription


antony

octavius i have seen more days than you
and though we lay these honours on this man
to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads
he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold
to groan and sweat under the business
either led or driven as we point the way
and having brought our treasure where we will
then take we down his load and turn him off
like to the empty ass to shake his ears
and graze in commons


octavius

you may do your will
but he a tried and valiant soldier


antony

so is my horse octavius and for that
i do appoint him store of provender
it is a creature that i teach to fight
to wind to stop to run directly on
his corporal motion govern by my spirit
and in some taste is lepidus but so
he must be taught and train and bid go forth
a barren-spirited fellow one that feeds
on abjects orts and imitations
which out of use and staled by other men
begin his fashion do not talk of him
but as a property and now octavius
listen great things brutus and cassius
are levying powers we must straight make head
therefore let our alliance be combined
our best friends made our means stretch
and let us presently go sit in council
how covert matters may be best disclosed
and open perils surest answered


octavius

let us do so for we are at the stake
and bay about with many enemies
and some that smile have in their hearts i fear
millions of mischiefs

brutus

stand ho


lucilius

give the word ho and stand


brutus

what now lucilius is cassius near


lucilius

he is at hand and pindarus is come
to do you salutation from his master


brutus

he greets me well your master pindarus
in his own change or by ill officers
hath given me some worthy cause to wish
things done undone but if he be at hand
i shall be satisfied


pindarus

i do not doubt
but that my noble master will appear
such as he is full of regard and honour


brutus

he is not doubted a word lucilius
how he received you let me be resolved


lucilius

with courtesy and with respect enough
but not with such familiar instances
nor with such free and friendly conference
as he hath used of old


brutus

thou hast described
a hot friend cooling ever note lucilius
when love begins to sicken and decay
it useth an enforced ceremony
there are no tricks in plain and simple faith
but hollow men like horses hot at hand
make gallant show and promise of their mettle
but when they should endure the bloody spur
they fall their crests and like deceitful jades
sink in the trial comes his army on


lucilius

they mean this night in sardis to be quarter
the greater part the horse in general
are come with cassius


brutus

hark he is arrived
low march within
march gently on to meet him

most noble brother you have done me wrong


brutus

judge me you gods wrong i mine enemies
and if not so how should i wrong a brother


cassius

brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs
and when you do them 


brutus

cassius be content
speak your griefs softly i do know you well
before the eyes of both our armies here
which should perceive nothing but love from us
let us not wrangle bid them move away
then in my tent cassius enlarge your griefs
and i will give you audience


cassius

pindarus
bid our commanders lead their charges off
a little from this ground


brutus

lucilius do you the like and let no man
come to our tent till we have done our conference
let lucius and titinius guard our door
exeunt

scene iii brutus tent

enter brutus and cassius


cassius

that you have wrong me doth appear in this
you have condemn and noted lucius pella
for taking bribes here of the sardians
wherein my letters praying on his side
because i knew the man were slighted off


brutus

you wronged yourself to write in such a case


cassius

in such a time as this it is not meet
that every nice offence should bear his comment


brutus

let me tell you cassius you yourself
are much condemn to have an itching palm
to sell and mart your offices for gold
to undeservers


cassius

i an itching palm
you know that you are brutus that speak this
or by the gods this speech were else your last


brutus

the name of cassius honours this corruption
and chastisement doth therefore hide his head


cassius

chastisement


brutus

remember march the ides of march remember
did not great julius bleed for justice sake
what villain touch his body that did stab
and not for justice what shall one of us
that struck the foremost man of all this world
but for supporting robbers shall we now
contaminate our fingers with base bribes
and sell the mighty space of our large honours
for so much trash as may be grasped thus
i had rather be a dog and bay the moon
than such a roman


cassius

brutus bay not me
ill not endure it you forget yourself
to hedge me in i am a soldier i
older in practise abler than yourself
to make conditions


brutus

go to you are not cassius


cassius

i am


brutus

i say you are not


cassius

urge me no more i shall forget myself
have mind upon your health tempt me no further


brutus

away slight man


cassius

ist possible


brutus

hear me for i will speak
must i give way and room to your rash choler
shall i be frighted when a madman stares


cassius

o ye gods ye gods must i endure all this


brutus

all this ay more fret till your proud heart break
go show your slaves how choleric you are
and make your bondmen tremble must i budge
must i observe you must i stand and crouch
under your testy humour by the gods
you shall digest the venom of your spleen
though it do split you for from this day forth
ill use you for my mirth yea for my laughter
when you are waspish


cassius

is it come to this


brutus

you say you are a better soldier
let it appear so make your vaunting true
and it shall please me well for mine own part
i shall be glad to learn of noble men


cassius

you wrong me every way you wrong me brutus
i said an elder soldier not a better
did i say better


brutus

if you did i care not


cassius

when caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me


brutus

peace peace you durst not so have tempted him


cassius

i durst not


brutus

no


cassius

what durst not tempt him


brutus

for your life you durst not


cassius

do not presume too much upon my love
i may do that i shall be sorry for


brutus

you have done that you should be sorry for
there is no terror cassius in your threats
for i am arm so strong in honesty
that they pass by me as the idle wind
which i respect not i did send to you
for certain sums of gold which you denied me
for i can raise no money by vile means
by heaven i had rather coin my heart
and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
by any indirection i did send
to you for gold to pay my legions
which you denied me was that done like cassius
should i have answer caius cassius so
when marcus brutus grows so covetous
to lock such rascal counters from his friends
be ready gods with all your thunderbolts
dash him to pieces


cassius

i denied you not


brutus

you did


cassius

i did not he was but a fool that brought
my answer back brutus hath rived my heart
a friend should bear his friend infirmities
but brutus makes mine greater than they are


brutus

i do not till you practise them on me


cassius

you love me not


brutus

i do not like your faults


cassius

a friendly eye could never see such faults


brutus

a flatterer would not though they do appear
as huge as high olympus


cassius

come antony and young octavius come
revenge yourselves alone on cassius
for cassius is aweary of the world
hated by one he loves braved by his brother
cheque like a bondman all his faults observed
set in a note-book learn and conn by rote
to cast into my teeth o i could weep
my spirit from mine eyes there is my dagger
and here my naked breast within a heart
dearer than plutus mine richer than gold
if that thou be a roman take it forth
i that denied thee gold will give my heart
strike as thou didst at caesar for i know
when thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better
than ever thou lovedst cassius


brutus

sheathe your dagger
be angry when you will it shall have scope
do what you will dishonour shall be humour
o cassius you are yoked with a lamb
that carries anger as the flint bears fire
who much enforced shows a hasty spark
and straight is cold again


cassius

hath cassius lived
to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus
when grief and blood ill-temper vexeth him


brutus

when i spoke that i was ill-temper too


cassius

do you confess so much give me your hand


brutus

and my heart too


cassius

o brutus


brutus

what the matter


cassius

have not you love enough to bear with me
when that rash humour which my mother gave me
makes me forgetful


brutus

yes cassius and from henceforth
when you are over-earnest with your brutus
hell think your mother chides and leave you so

if you give place to accidental evils


brutus

no man bears sorrow better portia is dead


cassius

ha portia


brutus

she is dead


cassius

how caped i killing when i cross you so
o insupportable and touching loss
upon what sickness


brutus

impatient of my absence
and grief that young octavius with mark antony
have made themselves so strong for with her death
that tidings came with this she fell distract
and her attendants absent swallow fire


cassius

and died so


brutus

even so


cassius

o ye immortal gods
re-enter lucius with wine and taper


brutus

speak no more of her give me a bowl of wine
in this i bury all unkindness cassius


cassius

my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge
fill lucius till the wine oerswell the cup
i cannot drink too much of brutus love


brutus

come in titinius
exit lucius
re-enter titinius with messala
welcome good messala
now sit we close about this taper here
and call in question our necessities


cassius

portia art thou gone


brutus

no more i pray you
messala i have here received letters
that young octavius and mark antony
come down upon us with a mighty power
bending their expedition toward philippi


messala

myself have letters of the selfsame tenor


brutus

with what addition


messala

that by proscription and bills of outlawry
octavius antony and lepidus
have put to death an hundred senators


brutus

therein our letters do not well agree
mine speak of seventy senators that died
by their proscriptions cicero being one


cassius

cicero one


messala

cicero is dead
and by that order of proscription
had you your letters from your wife my lord


brutus

no messala


messala

nor nothing in your letters writ of her


brutus

nothing messala


messala

that methinks is strange


brutus

why ask you hear you aught of her in yours


messala

no my lord


brutus

now as you are a roman tell me true


messala

then like a roman bear the truth i tell
for certain she is dead and by strange manner


brutus

why farewell portia we must die messala
with meditating that she must die once
i have the patience to endure it now


messala

even so great men great losses should endure


cassius

i have as much of this in art as you
but yet my nature could not bear it so


brutus

well to our work alive what do you think
of marching to philippi presently


cassius

i do not think it good


brutus

your reason


cassius

this it is
tis better that the enemy seek us
so shall he waste his means weary his soldiers
doing himself offence whilst we lying still
are full of rest defense and nimbleness


brutus

good reasons must of force give place to better
the people twixt philippi and this ground
do stand but in a forced affection
for they have grudged us contribution
the enemy marching along by them
by them shall make a fuller number up
come on refresh new-added and encouraged
from which advantage shall we cut him off
if at philippi we do face him there
these people at our back


cassius

hear me good brother


brutus

under your pardon you must note beside
that we have tried the utmost of our friends
our legions are brim-full our cause is ripe
the enemy increaseth every day
we at the height are ready to decline
there is a tide in the affairs of men
which taken at the flood leads on to fortune
omitted all the voyage of their life
is bound in shallows and in miseries
on such a full sea are we now afloat
and we must take the current when it serves
or lose our ventures


cassius

well along ourselves and meet them at philippi

exeunt

act v
scene i the plains of philippi

enter octavius antony and their army


octavius

now antony our hopes are answered
you said the enemy would not come down
but keep the hills and upper regions
it proves not so their battles are at hand
they mean to warn us at philippi here
answering before we do demand of them


antony

tut i am in their bosoms and i know
wherefore they do it they could be content
to visit other places and come down
with fearful bravery thinking by this face
to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage
but tis not so
enter a messenger


messenger

prepare you generals
the enemy comes on in gallant show
their bloody sign of battle is hung out
and something to be done immediately


antony

octavius lead your battle softly on
upon the left hand of the even field


octavius

upon the right hand i keep thou the left


antony

why do you cross me in this exigent


octavius

i do not cross you but i will do so
march
drum enter brutus cassius and their army lucilius titinius messala and others


brutus

they stand and would have parley


cassius

stand fast titinius we must out and talk


octavius

mark antony shall we give sign of battle


antony

no caesar we will answer on their charge
make forth the generals would have some words


octavius

stir not until the signal


brutus

words before blows is it so countrymen


octavius

not that we love words better as you do


brutus

good words are better than bad strokes octavius


antony

in your bad strokes brutus you give good words
witness the hole you made in caesar heart
crying long live hail caesar


cassius

antony
the posture of your blows are yet unknown
but for your words they rob the hybla bees
and leave them honeyless


antony

not stingless too


brutus

o yes and soundless too
for you have stoln their buzzing antony
and very wisely threat before you sting


antony

villains you did not so when your vile daggers
hack one another in the sides of caesar
you show your teeth like apes and fawn like hounds
and bow like bondmen kissing caesar feet
whilst damned casca like a cur behind
struck caesar on the neck o you flatterers


cassius

flatterers now brutus thank yourself
this tongue had not offended so to-day
if cassius might have ruled


octavius

come come the cause if arguing make us sweat
the proof of it will turn to redder drops look
i draw a sword against conspirators
when think you that the sword goes up again
never till caesar three and thirty wounds
be well avenged or till another caesar
have added slaughter to the sword of traitors


brutus

caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands
unless thou bring them with thee


octavius

so i hope
i was not born to die on brutus sword


brutus

o if thou wert the noblest of thy strain
young man thou couldst not die more honourable


cassius

a peevish schoolboy worthless of such honour
join with a masker and a reveller


antony

old cassius still


octavius

come antony away
defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth
if you dare fight to-day come to the field
if not when you have stomachs
exeunt octavius antony and their army


cassius

why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark
the storm is up and all is on the hazard


brutus

ho lucilius hark a word with you


lucilius

standing forthmy lord
brutus and lucilius converse apart


cassius

messala


messala

standing forth  what says my general


cassius

messala
this is my birth-day as this very day
was cassius born give me thy hand messala
be thou my witness that against my will
as pompey was am i compell to set
upon one battle all our liberties
you know that i held epicurus strong
and his opinion now i change my mind
and partly credit things that do presage
coming from sardis on our former ensign
two mighty eagles fell and there they perch
gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands
who to philippi here consorted us
this morning are they fled away and gone
and in their steads do ravens crows and kites
fly oer our heads and downward look on us
as we were sickly prey their shadows seem
a canopy most fatal under which
our army lies ready to give up the ghost


messala

believe not so


cassius

i but believe it partly
for i am fresh of spirit and resolved
to meet all perils very constantly


brutus

even so lucilius


cassius

now most noble brutus
the gods to-day stand friendly that we may
lovers in peace lead on our days to age
but since the affairs of men rest still incertain
let reason with the worst that may befall
if we do lose this battle then is this
the very last time we shall speak together
what are you then determined to do


brutus

even by the rule of that philosophy
by which i did blame cato for the death
which he did give himself i know not how
but i do find it cowardly and vile
for fear of what might fall so to prevent
the time of life arming myself with patience
to stay the providence of some high powers
that govern us below


cassius

then if we lose this battle
you are contented to be led in triumph
thorough the streets of rome


brutus

no cassius no think not thou noble roman
that ever brutus will go bound to rome
he bears too great a mind but this same day
must end that work the ides of march begun
and whether we shall meet again i know not
therefore our everlasting farewell take
for ever and for ever farewell cassius
if we do meet again why we shall smile
if not why then this parting was well made


cassius

for ever and for ever farewell brutus
if we do meet again well smile indeed
if not tis true this parting was well made


brutus

why then lead on o that a man might know
the end of this day business ere it come
but it sufficeth that the day will end
and then the end is known come ho away

cassius

o look titinius look the villains fly
myself have to mine own turn enemy
this ensign here of mine was turning back
i slew the coward and did take it from him


titinius

who having some advantage on octavius
took it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoil
whilst we by antony are all enclosed
enter pindarus


pindarus

fly further off my lord fly further off
mark antony is in your tents my lord
fly therefore noble cassius fly far off


cassius

titinius

cassius

titinius if thou lovest me
mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him
till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
and here again that i may rest assured
whether yond troops are friend or enemy


titinius

i will be here again even with a thought
exit


cassius

go pindarus get higher on that hill
my sight was ever thick regard titinius
and tell me what thou notest about the field
pindarus ascends the hill

and where i did begin there shall i end

cassius

come down behold no more
o coward that i am to live so long
to see my best friend taen before my face
pindarus descends
come hither sirrah
in parthia did i take thee prisoner
and then i swore thee saving of thy life
that whatsoever i did bid thee do
thou shouldst attempt it come now keep thine oath
now be a freeman and with this good sword
that ran through caesar bowels search this bosom
stand not to answer here take thou the hilts
and when my face is cover as tis now
guide thou the sword
pindarus stabs him

exit
re-enter titinius with messala


messala

as cassius legions are by antony


titinius

these tidings will well comfort cassius


messala

where did you leave him


titinius

all disconsolate
with pindarus his bondman on this hill


messala

is not that he t hat lies upon the ground


titinius

he lies not like the living o my heart


messala

is not that he


titinius

no this was he messala
but cassius is no more o setting sun
as in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night
so in his red blood cassius day is set
the sun of rome is set our day is gone
clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done
mistrust of my success hath done this deed


messala

mistrust of good success hath done this deed
o hateful error melancholy child
why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
the things that are not o error soon conceived
thou never comest unto a happy birth
but kill the mother that engender thee


titinius

what pindarus where art thou pindarus


messala

seek him titinius whilst i go to meet
the noble brutus thrusting this report
into his ears i may say thrusting it
for piercing steel and darts envenomed
shall be as welcome to the ears of brutus
as tidings of this sight


titinius

hie you messala
and i will seek for pindarus the while
exit messala
why didst thou send me forth brave cassius
did i not meet thy friends and did not they
put on my brows this wreath of victory
and bid me give it thee didst thou not hear their shouts
alas thou hast misconstrued every thing
but hold thee take this garland on thy brow
thy brutus bid me give it thee and i
will do his bidding brutus come apace
and see how i regarded caius cassius

antony

this is not brutus friend but i assure you

volumnius

brutus

nay i am sure it is volumnius
thou seest the world volumnius how it goes
our enemies have beat us to the pit
low alarums

than tarry till they push us good volumnius

messala

octavius then take him to follow thee
that did the latest service to my master


antony

this was the noblest roman of them all
all the conspirators save only he
did that they did in envy of great caesar
he only in a general honest thought
and common good to all made one of them
his life was gentle and the elements
so mix in him that nature might stand up
and say to all the world this was a man


octavius

according to his virtue let us use him
with all respect and rites of burial
within my tent his bones to-night shall lie
most like a soldier order honourably
so call the field to rest and let away
to part the glories of this happy day

kent

i thought the king had more affected the duke of
albany than cornwall


gloucester

it did always seem so to us but now in the
division of the kingdom it appears not which of
the dukes he values most for equalities are so
weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice
of either moiety


kent

is not this your son my lord


gloucester

his breeding sir hath been at my charge i have
so often blushed to acknowledge him that now i am
brazed to it


kent

i cannot conceive you


gloucester

sir this young fellow mother could whereupon
she grew round-wombed and had indeed sir a son
for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed
do you smell a fault


kent

i cannot wish the fault undone the issue of it
being so proper


gloucester

but i have sir a son by order of law some year
elder than this who yet is no dearer in my account
though this knave came something saucily into the
world before he was sent for yet was his mother
fair there was good sport at his making and the
whoreson must be acknowledged do you know this
noble gentleman edmund

meantime we shall express our darker purpose
give me the map there know that we have divided
in three our kingdom and tis our fast intent
to shake all cares and business from our age
conferring them on younger strengths while we
unburthen crawl toward death our son of cornwall
and you our no less loving son of albany
we have this hour a constant will to publish
our daughters several dowers that future strife
may be prevented now the princes france and burgundy
great rivals in our youngest daughter love
long in our court have made their amorous sojourn
and here are to be answer tell me my daughters 
since now we will divest us both of rule
interest of territory cares of state 
which of you shall we say doth love us most
that we our largest bounty may extend
where nature doth with merit challenge goneril
our eldest-born speak first


goneril

sir i love you more than words can wield the matter
dearer than eye-sight space and liberty
beyond what can be valued rich or rare
no less than life with grace health beauty honour
as much as child eer loved or father found
a love that makes breath poor and speech unable
beyond all manner of so much i love you


cordelia

aside  what shall cordelia do
love and be silent


lear

of all these bounds even from this line to this
with shadowy forests and with champains rich
with plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads
we make thee lady to thine and albany issue
be this perpetual what says our second daughter
our dearest regan wife to cornwall speak


regan

sir i am made
of the self-same metal that my sister is
and prize me at her worth in my true heart
i find she names my very deed of love
only she comes too short that i profess
myself an enemy to all other joys
which the most precious square of sense possesses
and find i am alone felicitate
in your dear highness love


cordelia

asidethen poor cordelia
and yet not so since i am sure my love
more richer than my tongue


king lear

to thee and thine hereditary ever
remain this ample third of our fair kingdom
no less in space validity and pleasure
than that conferr on goneril now our joy
although the last not least to whose young love
the vines of france and milk of burgundy

a third more opulent than your sisters speak


cordelia

nothing will come of nothing speak again

unhappy that i am i cannot heave
my heart into my mouth i love your majesty
according to my bond nor more nor less

lest it may mar your fortunes


cordelia

good my lord
you have begot me bred me loved me i
return those duties back as are right fit
obey you love you and most honour you
why have my sisters husbands if they say
they love you all haply when i shall wed

king lear

let it be so thy truth then be thy dower
for by the sacred radiance of the sun
the mysteries of hecate and the night
by all the operation of the orbs
from whom we do exist and cease to be

propinquity and property of blood
and as a stranger to my heart and me
hold thee from this for ever the barbarous scythian

to gorge his appetite shall to my bosom
be as well neighbour pitied and relieved
as thou my sometime daughter

with my two daughters dowers digest this third
let pride which she calls plainness marry her
i do invest you jointly with my power
pre-eminence and all the large effects
that troop with majesty ourself by monthly course
with reservation of an hundred knights
by you to be sustain shall our abode

think thou that duty shall have dread to speak
when power to flattery bows to plainness honour bound
when majesty stoops to folly reverse thy doom
and in thy best consideration cheque
this hideous rashness answer my life my judgment
thy youngest daughter does not love thee least
nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
reverbs no hollowness


king lear

on thine allegiance hear me
since thou hast sought to make us break our vow
which we durst never yet and with strain pride
to come between our sentence and our power
which nor our nature nor our place can bear
our potency made good take thy reward
five days we do allot thee for provision
to shield thee from diseases of the world
and on the sixth to turn thy hated back

hath rivall for our daughter what in the least
will you require in present dower with her
or cease your quest of love


burgundy

most royal majesty
i crave no more than what your highness offer
nor will you tender less


king lear

right noble burgundy
when she was dear to us we did hold her so
but now her price is falln sir there she stands
if aught within that little seeming substance
or all of it with our displeasure pieced
and nothing more may fitly like your grace
she there and she is yours


burgundy

i know no answer


king lear

will you with those infirmities she owes
unfriended new-adopted to our hate
dower with our curse and stranger with our oath
take her or leave her


burgundy

pardon me royal sir
election makes not up on such conditions


king lear

then leave her sir for by the power that made me
i tell you all her wealth
to king of france
for you great king
i would not from your love make such a stray
to match you where i hate therefore beseech you
to avert your liking a more worthier way
than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
almost to acknowledge hers


king of france

this is most strange
that she that even but now was your best object
the argument of your praise balm of your age
most best most dearest should in this trice of time
commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
so many folds of favour sure her offence
must be of such unnatural degree
that monsters it or your fore-vouch affection
falln into taint which to believe of her
must be a faith that reason without miracle
could never plant in me


cordelia

i yet beseech your majesty 
if for i want that glib and oily art
to speak and purpose not since what i well intend
ill dot before i speak that you make known
it is no vicious blot murder or foulness
no unchaste action or dishonour step
that hath deprived me of your grace and favour
but even for want of that for which i am richer
a still-soliciting eye and such a tongue
as i am glad i have not though not to have it
hath lost me in your liking


king lear

better thou
hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better


king of france

is it but this a tardiness in nature
which often leaves the history unspoke
that it intends to do my lord of burgundy
what say you to the lady love not love
when it is mingled with regards that stand
aloof from the entire point will you have her
she is herself a dowry


burgundy

royal lear
give but that portion which yourself proposed
and here i take cordelia by the hand
duchess of burgundy


king lear

nothing i have sworn i am firm


burgundy

i am sorry then you have so lost a father
that you must lose a husband


cordelia

peace be with burgundy
since that respects of fortune are his love
i shall not be his wife


king of france

fairest cordelia that art most rich being poor
most choice forsaken and most loved despised
thee and thy virtues here i seize upon
be it lawful i take up what cast away
gods gods tis strange that from their cold neglect
my love should kindle to inflamed respect
thy dowerless daughter king thrown to my chance
is queen of us of ours and our fair france
not all the dukes of waterish burgundy
can buy this unprized precious maid of me
bid them farewell cordelia though unkind
thou losest here a better where to find


king lear

thou hast her france let her be thine for we
have no such daughter nor shall ever see
that face of hers again therefore be gone
without our grace our love our benison
come noble burgundy
flourish exeunt all but king of france goneril regan and cordelia


king of france

bid farewell to your sisters


cordelia

the jewels of our father with wash eyes
cordelia leaves you i know you what you are
and like a sister am most loath to call
your faults as they are named use well our father
to your professed bosoms i commit him
but yet alas stood i within his grace
i would prefer him to a better place
so farewell to you both


regan

prescribe not us our duties


goneril

let your study
be to content your lord who hath received you
at fortune alms you have obedience scanted
and well are worth the want that you have wanted


cordelia

time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides
who cover faults at last shame them derides
well may you prosper


king of france

come my fair cordelia
exeunt king of france and cordelia


goneril

sister it is not a little i have to say of what
most nearly appertains to us both i think our
father will hence to-night


regan

that most certain and with you next month with us


goneril

you see how full of changes his age is the
observation we have made of it hath not been
little he always loved our sister most and
with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
appears too grossly


regan

tis the infirmity of his age yet he hath ever
but slenderly known himself


goneril

the best and soundest of his time hath been but
rash then must we look to receive from his age
not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed
condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness
that infirm and choleric years bring with them


regan

such unconstant starts are we like to have from
him as this of kent banishment


goneril

there is further compliment of leavetaking
between france and him pray you let hit
together if our father carry authority with
such dispositions as he bears this last
surrender of his will but offend us


regan

we shall further think ont


goneril

we must do something and i the heat

scene ii the earl of gloucester castle

enter edmund with a letter


edmund

thou nature art my goddess to thy law

stand in the plague of custom and permit
the curiosity of nations to deprive me

lag of a brother why bastard wherefore base
when my dimensions are as well compact
my mind as generous and my shape as true
as honest madam issue why brand they us
with base with baseness bastardy base base

it into your pocket the quality of nothing hath
not such need to hide itself let see come
if it be nothing i shall not need spectacles


edmund

i beseech you sir pardon me it is a letter
from my brother that i have not all oer-read
and for so much as i have perused i find it not
fit for your oer-looking


gloucester

give me the letter sir


edmund

i shall offend either to detain or give it the
contents as in part i understand them are to blame


gloucester

let see let see


edmund

i hope for my brother justification he wrote
this but as an essay or taste of my virtue


gloucester

reads  this policy and reverence of age makes
the world bitter to the best of our times keeps
our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish
them i begin to find an idle and fond bondage
in the oppression of aged tyranny who sways not
as it hath power but as it is suffered come to
me that of this i may speak more if our father
would sleep till i waked him you should half his
revenue for ever and live the beloved of your
brotheredgar
hum conspiracy leep till i waked him you
should enjoy half his revenue my son edgar
had he a hand to write this a heart and brain
to breed it in when came this to you who
brought it


edmund

it was not brought me my lord there the
cunning of it i found it thrown in at the
casement of my closet


gloucester

you know the character to be your brother


edmund

if the matter were good my lord i durst swear
it were his but in respect of that i would
fain think it were not


gloucester

it is his


edmund

it is his hand my lord but i hope his heart is
not in the contents


gloucester

hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business


edmund

never my lord but i have heard him oft
maintain it to be fit that sons at perfect age
and fathers declining the father should be as
ward to the son and the son manage his revenue


gloucester

o villain villain his very opinion in the
letter abhorred villain unnatural detested
brutish villain worse than brutish go sirrah
seek him ill apprehend him abominable villain
where is he


edmund

i do not well know my lord if it shall please
you to suspend your indignation against my
brother till you can derive from him better
testimony of his intent you shall run a certain
course where if you violently proceed against
him mistaking his purpose it would make a great
gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the
heart of his obedience i dare pawn down my life
for him that he hath wrote this to feel my
affection to your honour and to no further
pretence of danger


gloucester

think you so


edmund

if your honour judge it meet i will place you
where you shall hear us confer of this and by an
auricular assurance have your satisfaction and
that without any further delay than this very evening


gloucester

he cannot be such a monster 


edmund

nor is not sure


gloucester

to his father that so tenderly and entirely
loves him heaven and earth edmund seek him
out wind me into him i pray you frame the
business after your own wisdom i would unstate
myself to be in a due resolution


edmund

i will seek him sir presently convey the
business as i shall find means and acquaint you withal


gloucester

these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend
no good to us though the wisdom of nature can
reason it thus and thus yet nature finds itself
scourged by the sequent effects love cools
friendship falls off brothers divide in
cities mutinies in countries discord in
palaces treason and the bond cracked twixt son
and father this villain of mine comes under the
prediction there son against father the king
falls from bias of nature there father against
child we have seen the best of our time
machinations hollowness treachery and all
ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our
graves find out this villain edmund it shall
lose thee nothing do it carefully and the
noble and true-hearted kent banished his
offence honesty tis strange
exit


edmund

this is the excellent foppery of the world that
when we are sick in fortune often the surfeit
of our own behavior we make guilty of our
disasters the sun the moon and the stars as
if we were villains by necessity fools by
heavenly compulsion knaves thieves and
treachers by spherical predominance drunkards
liars and adulterers by an enforced obedience of
planetary influence and all that we are evil in
by a divine thrusting on an admirable evasion
of whoremaster man to lay his goatish
disposition to the charge of a star my
father compounded with my mother under the
dragon tail and my nativity was under ursa
major so that it follows i am rough and
lecherous tut i should have been that i am
had the maidenliest star in the firmament
twinkled on my bastardizing edgar 
enter edgar
and pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old
comedy my cue is villanous melancholy with a
sigh like tom o bedlam o these eclipses do
portend these divisions fa sol la mi


edgar

how now brother edmund what serious
contemplation are you in


edmund

i am thinking brother of a prediction i read
this other day what should follow these eclipses


edgar

do you busy yourself about that


edmund

i promise you the effects he writes of succeed
unhappily as of unnaturalness between the child
and the parent death dearth dissolutions of
ancient amities divisions in state menaces and
maledictions against king and nobles needless
diffidences banishment of friends dissipation
of cohorts nuptial breaches and i know not what


edgar

how long have you been a sectary astronomical


edmund

come come when saw you my father last


edgar

why the night gone by


edmund

spake you with him


edgar

ay two hours together


edmund

parted you in good terms found you no
displeasure in him by word or countenance


edgar

none at all


edmund

bethink yourself wherein you may have offended
him and at my entreaty forbear his presence
till some little time hath qualified the heat of
his displeasure which at this instant so rageth
in him that with the mischief of your person it
would scarcely allay


edgar

some villain hath done me wrong


edmund

that my fear i pray you have a continent
forbearance till the spied of his rage goes
slower and as i say retire with me to my
lodging from whence i will fitly bring you to
hear my lord speak pray ye go there my key
if you do stir abroad go armed


edgar

armed brother


edmund

brother i advise you to the best go armed i
am no honest man if there be any good meaning
towards you i have told you what i have seen
and heard but faintly nothing like the image
and horror of it pray you away


edgar

shall i hear from you anon


edmund

i do serve you in this business
exit edgar
a credulous father and a brother noble
whose nature is so far from doing harms
that he suspects none on whose foolish honesty
my practises ride easy i see the business
let me if not by birth have lands by wit
all with me meet that i can fashion fit

judgment your highness is not entertained with that

general dependants as in the duke himself also and
your daughter

knight

for my duty cannot be silent when i think your
highness wronged

do hourly carp and quarrel breaking forth
in rank and not-to-be endured riots sir
i had thought by making this well known unto you
to have found a safe redress but now grow fearful
by what yourself too late have spoke and done
that you protect this course and put it on
by your allowance which if you should the fault
would not cape censure nor the redresses sleep
which in the tender of a wholesome weal
might in their working do you that offence
which else were shame that then necessity
will call discreet proceeding

suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend
to make this creature fruitful
into her womb convey sterility
dry up in her the organs of increase
and from her derogate body never spring
a babe to honour her if she must teem
create her child of spleen that it may live
and be a thwart disnatured torment to her

with cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks
turn all her mother pains and benefits
to laughter and contempt that she may feel
how sharper than a serpent tooth it is

who wears no honesty such smiling rogues as these
like rats oft bite the holy cords a-twain
which are too intrinse t unloose smooth every passion
that in the natures of their lords rebel
bring oil to fire snow to their colder moods
renege affirm and turn their halcyon beaks
with every gale and vary of their masters
knowing nought like dogs but following
a plague upon your epileptic visage

ild drive ye cackling home to camelot

no more perchance does mine nor his nor hers


kent

sir tis my occupation to be plain
i have seen better faces in my time
than stands on any shoulder that i see

cornwall

this is some fellow
who having been praised for bluntness doth affect
a saucy roughness and constrains the garb
quite from his nature he cannot flatter he
an honest mind and plain he must speak truth
an they will take it so if not he plain
these kind of knaves i know which in this plainness
harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
than twenty silly ducking observants
that stretch their duties nicely


kent

sir in good sooth in sincere verity
under the allowance of your great aspect
whose influence like the wreath of radiant fire
on flickering phoebus front 


cornwall

what mean by this


kent

to go out of my dialect which you
discommend so much i know sir i am no
flatterer he that beguiled you in a plain
accent was a plain knave which for my part
i will not be though i should win your displeasure
to entreat me to t


cornwall

what was the offence you gave him


oswald

i never gave him any
it pleased the king his master very late
to strike at me upon his misconstruction
when he conjunct and flattering his displeasure
tripp me behind being down insulted rail
and put upon him such a deal of man
that worthied him got praises of the king
for him attempting who was self-subdued
and in the fleshment of this dread exploit
drew on me here again

that he so slightly valued in his messenger

scene iii a wood

edgar

i heard myself proclaim
and by the happy hollow of a tree
escaped the hunt no port is free no place
that guard and most unusual vigilance
does not attend my taking whiles i may cape
i will preserve myself and am bethought
to take the basest and most poorest shape
that ever penury in contempt of man
brought near to beast my face ill grime with filth
blanket my loins elf all my hair in knots
and with presented nakedness out-face
the winds and persecutions of the sky
the country gives me proof and precedent
of bedlam beggars who with roaring voices
strike in their numb and mortified bare arms
pins wooden pricks nails sprigs of rosemary
and with this horrible object from low farms
poor pelting villages sheep-cotes and mills
sometime with lunatic bans sometime with prayers
enforce their charity poor turlygod poor tom
that something yet edgar i nothing am

resolve me with all modest haste which way
thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage
coming from us


kent

my lord when at their home
i did commend your highness letters to them
ere i was risen from the place that show
my duty kneeling came there a reeking post
stew in his haste half breathless panting forth
from goneril his mistress salutations
deliver letters spite of intermission
which presently they read on whose contents
they summon up their meiny straight took horse
commanded me to follow and attend
the leisure of their answer gave me cold looks
and meeting here the other messenger
whose welcome i perceived had poison mine 
being the very fellow that of late
display so saucily against your highness 
having more man than wit about me drew
he raised the house with loud and coward cries
your son and daughter found this trespass worth
the shame which here it suffers


fool

winter not gone yet if the wild-geese fly that way
fathers that wear rags
do make their children blind
but fathers that bear bags
shall see their children kind
fortune that arrant whore
neer turns the key to the poor
but for all this thou shalt have as many dolours
for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year

question thou hadst well deserved it

fool

well set thee to school to an ant to teach thee
there no labouring i the winter all that follow
their noses are led by their eyes but blind men and
there not a nose among twenty but can smell him
that stinking let go thy hold when a great wheel
runs down a hill lest it break thy neck with
following it but the great one that goes up the
hill let him draw thee after when a wise man
gives thee better counsel give me mine again i
would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it
that sir which serves and seeks for gain
and follows but for form
will pack when it begins to rain
and leave thee in the storm
but i will tarry the fool will stay
and let the wise man fly
the knave turns fool that runs away

if you do love old men if your sweet sway
allow obedience if yourselves are old

to goneril
art not ashamed to look upon this beard
o regan wilt thou take her by the hand


goneril

why not by the hand sir how have i offended
all not offence that indiscretion finds
and dotage terms so


king lear

o sides you are too tough
will you yet hold how came my man i the stocks


cornwall

i set him there sir but his own disorders
deserved much less advancement


king lear

you will return and sojourn with my sister
dismissing half your train come then to me
i am now from home and out of that provision
which shall be needful for your entertainment


king lear

return to her and fifty men dismiss
no rather i abjure all roofs and choose
to wage against the enmity o the air
to be a comrade with the wolf and owl 
necessity sharp pinch return with her
why the hot-blooded france that dowerless took
our youngest born i could as well be brought
to knee his throne and squire-like pension beg
to keep base life afoot return with her
persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
to this detested groom
pointing at oswald


goneril

at your choice sir


king lear

i prithee daughter do not make me mad
i will not trouble thee my child farewell
well no more meet no more see one another
but yet thou art my flesh my blood my daughter
or rather a disease that in my flesh
which i must needs call mine thou art a boil
a plague-sore an embossed carbuncle
in my corrupted blood but ill not chide thee
let shame come when it will i do not call it
i do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot
nor tell tales of thee to high-judging jove
mend when thou canst be better at thy leisure
i can be patient i can stay with regan
i and my hundred knights


regan

not altogether so
i look not for you yet nor am provided
for your fit welcome give ear sir to my sister
for those that mingle reason with your passion
must be content to think you old and so 
but she knows what she does


king lear

is this well spoken


regan

i dare avouch it sir what fifty followers
is it not well what should you need of more
yea or so many sith that both charge and danger
speak gainst so great a number how in one house
should many people under two commands
hold amity tis hard almost impossible


goneril

why might not you my lord receive attendance
from those that she calls servants or from mine


regan

why not my lord if then they chanced to slack you
we could control them if you will come to me 
for now i spy a danger i entreat you
to bring but five and twenty to no more
will i give place or notice


king lear

i gave you all 


regan

but kept a reservation to be follow
with such a number what must i come to you

king lear

those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour
when others are more wicked not being the worst
stands in some rank of praise
to goneril
ill go with thee
thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty
and thou art twice her love


goneril

hear me my lord
what need you five and twenty ten or five
to follow in a house where twice so many
have a command to tend you


regan

what need one


king lear

o reason not the need our basest beggars
are in the poorest thing superfluous
allow not nature more than nature needs
man life as cheap as beast thou art a lady
if only to go warm were gorgeous
why nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear
which scarcely keeps thee warm but for true need 
you heavens give me that patience patience i need
you see me here you gods a poor old man
as full of grief as age wretched in both
if it be you that stir these daughters hearts
against their father fool me not so much
to bear it tamely touch me with noble anger
and let not women weapons water-drops
stain my man cheeks no you unnatural hags
i will have such revenges on you both
that all the world shall i will do such things 
what they are yet i know not but they shall be
the terrors of the earth you think ill weep
no ill not weep
i have full cause of weeping but this heart
shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
or ere ill weep o fool i shall go mad

that things might change or cease tears his white hair
which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage
catch in their fury and make nothing of
strives in his little world of man to out-scorn
the to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain

the lion and the belly-pinched wolf
keep their fur dry unbonneted he runs
and bids what will take all


kent

but who is with him


gentleman

none but the fool who labours to out-jest
his heart-struck injuries

sir i do know you
and dare upon the warrant of my note
commend a dear thing to you there is division
although as yet the face of it be cover
with mutual cunning twixt albany and cornwall
who have as who have not that their great stars
throned and set high servants who seem no less
which are to france the spies and speculations
intelligent of our state what hath been seen
either in snuffs and packings of the dukes
or the hard rein which both of them have borne
against the old kind king or something deeper
whereof perchance these are but furnishings
but true it is from france there comes a power
into this scatter kingdom who already
wise in our negligence have secret feet
in some of our best ports and are at point
to show their open banner now to you
if on my credit you dare build so far
to make your speed to dover you shall find
some that will thank you making just report
of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
the king hath cause to plain
i am a gentleman of blood and breeding
and from some knowledge and assurance offer
this office to you


gentleman

as fear not but you shall show her this ring
and she will tell you who your fellow is

fool

remember to have heard man nature cannot carry
the affliction nor the fear


king lear

that hast within thee undivulged crimes
unwhipp of justice hide thee thou bloody hand

hast practised on man life close pent-up guilts

king lear

exeunt king lear and kent


fool

this is a brave night to cool a courtezan
ill speak a prophecy ere i go
when priests are more in word than matter
when brewers mar their malt with water
when nobles are their tailors tutors
no heretics burn but wenches suitors
when every case in law is right
no squire in debt nor no poor knight
when slanders do not live in tongues
nor cutpurses come not to throngs
when usurers tell their gold i the field
and bawds and whores do churches build
then shall the realm of albion
come to great confusion
then comes the time who lives to seet
that going shall be used with feet
this prophecy merlin shall make for i live before his time

and told me i had turn the wrong side out
what most he should dislike seems pleasant to him
what like offensive


goneril

o goneril
you are not worth the dust which the rude wind
blows in your face i fear your disposition

from her material sap perforce must wither

albany

wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile
filths savour but themselves what have you done
tigers not daughters what have you perform
a father and a gracious aged man
whose reverence even the head-lugg bear would lick
most barbarous most degenerate have you madded
could my good brother suffer you to do it
a man a prince by him so benefited
if that the heavens do not their visible spirits
send quickly down to tame these vile offences
it will come
humanity must perforce prey on itself
like monsters of the deep


goneril

milk-liver man
that bear a cheek for blows a head for wrongs
who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
thine honour from thy suffering that not know
fools do those villains pity who are punish
ere they have done their mischief where thy drum
france spreads his banners in our noiseless land
with plumed helm thy slayer begins threats
whiles thou a moral fool sit still and criest
alack why does he so


albany

see thyself devil
proper deformity seems not in the fiend
so horrid as in woman


goneril

o vain fool


albany

thou changed and self-cover thing for shame
be-monster not thy feature weret my fitness
to let these hands obey my blood
they are apt enough to dislocate and tear
thy flesh and bones howeer thou art a fiend
a woman shape doth shield thee

fear and danger that his personal return was
most required and necessary


kent

gentleman

the marshal of france monsieur la far


kent

did your letters pierce the queen to any
demonstration of grief


gentleman

and now and then an ample tear trill down
her delicate cheek it seem she was a queen
over her passion who most rebel-like
sought to be king oer her


kent

o then it moved her


gentleman

not to a rage patience and sorrow strove
who should express her goodliest you have seen
sunshine and rain at once her smiles and tears
were like a better way those happy smilets
that play on her ripe lip seem not to know
what guests were in her eyes which parted thence
as pearls from diamonds dropp in brief
sorrow would be a rarity most beloved
if all could so become it


kent

made she no verbal question


gentleman

faith once or twice she heaved the name of father
pantingly forth as if it press her heart
cried isters sisters shame of ladies sisters
kent father sisters what i the storm i the night
let pity not be believed there she shook
the holy water from her heavenly eyes
and clamour moisten then away she started
to deal with grief alone


kent

it is the stars
the stars above us govern our conditions
else one self mate and mate could not beget
such different issues you spoke not with her since


gentleman

no


kent

was this before the king return


gentleman

and bring him to our eye
exit an officer
what can man wisdom
in the restoring his bereaved sense
he that helps him take all my outward worth


doctor

are many simples operative whose power
will close the eye of anguish

gloucester

edgar

come on sir here the place stand still how fearful
and dizzy tis to cast one eyes so low
the crows and choughs that wing the midway air
show scarce so gross as beetles half way down
hangs one that gathers samphire dreadful trade
methinks he seems no bigger than his head
the fishermen that walk upon the beach
appear like mice and yond tall anchoring bark
diminish to her cock her cock a buoy
almost too small for sight the murmuring surge
that on the unnumber idle pebbles chafes
cannot be heard so high ill look no more
lest my brain turn and the deficient sight
topple down headlong


gloucester

set me where you stand


edgar

give me your hand you are now within a foot
of the extreme verge for all beneath the moon

burn itself out if edgar live o bless him
now fellow fare thee well
he falls forward


edgar

gone sir farewell
and yet i know not how conceit may rob
the treasury of life when life itself
yields to the theft had he been where he thought

thus might he pass indeed yet he revives
what are you sir


gloucester

and frustrate his proud will

king lear

albany

sir you have shown to-day your valiant strain
and fortune led you well you have the captives
that were the opposites of this day strife
we do require them of you so to use them
as we shall find their merits and our safety
may equally determine


edmund

sir i thought it fit
to send the old and miserable king
to some retention and appointed guard
whose age has charms in it whose title more
to pluck the common bosom on his side
an turn our impress lances in our eyes
which do command them with him i sent the queen
my reason all the same and they are ready
to-morrow or at further space to appear
where you shall hold your session at this time
we sweat and bleed the friend hath lost his friend
and the best quarrels in the heat are cursed
by those that feel their sharpness
the question of cordelia and her father
requires a fitter place


albany

sir by your patience
i hold you but a subject of this war
not as a brother


regan

that as we list to grace him
methinks our pleasure might have been demanded
ere you had spoke so far he led our powers
bore the commission of my place and person
the which immediacy may well stand up
and call itself your brother


goneril

not so hot
in his own grace he doth exalt himself
more than in your addition


regan

in my rights
by me invested he compeers the best


goneril

that were the most if he should husband you


regan

jesters do oft prove prophets


goneril

holla holla
that eye that told you so look but a-squint


regan

herald

this present summons


edgar

know my name is lost
by treason tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit
yet am i noble as the adversary
i come to cope


albany

which is that adversary


edgar

what he that speaks for edmund earl of gloucester


edmund

himself what say thou to him


edgar

draw thy sword
that if my speech offend a noble heart
thy arm may do thee justice here is mine
behold it is the privilege of mine honours
my oath and my profession i protest
maugre thy strength youth place and eminence
despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune
thy valour and thy heart thou art a traitor
false to thy gods thy brother and thy father
conspirant gainst this high-illustrious prince
and from the extremest upward of thy head
to the descent and dust below thy foot
a most toad-spotted traitor say thou no
this sword this arm and my best spirits are bent
to prove upon thy heart whereto i speak
thou liest


edmund

in wisdom i should ask thy name
but since thy outside looks so fair and warlike
and that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes
what safe and nicely i might well delay
by rule of knighthood i disdain and spurn
back do i toss these treasons to thy head
with the hell-hated lie oerwhelm thy heart
which for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise
this sword of mine shall give them instant way
where they shall rest for ever trumpets speak
alarums they fight edmund falls


albany

save him save him


goneril

this is practise gloucester
by the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
an unknown opposite thou art not vanquish
but cozen and beguiled


albany

shut your mouth dame
or with this paper shall i stop it hold sir
thou worse than any name read thine own evil
no tearing lady i perceive you know it
gives the letter to edmund


goneril

say if i do the laws are mine not thine
who can arraign me fort


albany

most monstrous oh
know thou this paper


goneril

ask me not what i know
exit


albany

go after her she desperate govern her


edmund

what you have charged me with that have i done
and more much more the time will bring it out
tis past and so am i but what art thou
that hast this fortune on me if thourt noble
i do forgive thee


edgar

let exchange charity
i am no less in blood than thou art edmund
if more the more thou hast wrong me
my name is edgar and thy father son
the gods are just and of our pleasant vices
make instruments to plague us
the dark and vicious place where thee he got
cost him his eyes


edmund

thou hast spoken right tis true
the wheel is come full circle i am here


albany

methought thy very gait did prophesy
a royal nobleness i must embrace thee
let sorrow split my heart if ever i
did hate thee or thy father


edgar

worthy prince i knowt


albany

where have you hid yourself
how have you known the miseries of your father


edgar

by nursing them my lord list a brief tale
and when tis told o that my heart would burst
the bloody proclamation to escape
that follow me so near o our lives sweetness
that we the pain of death would hourly die
rather than die at once taught me to shift
into a madman rags to assume a semblance
that very dogs disdain and in this habit
met i my father with his bleeding rings
their precious stones new lost became his guide
led him begg for him saved him from despair
never o fault reveal myself unto him
until some half-hour past when i was arm
not sure though hoping of this good success
i ask his blessing and from first to last
told him my pilgrimage but his flaw heart
alack too weak the conflict to support
twixt two extremes of passion joy and grief
burst smilingly


edmund

this speech of yours hath moved me
and shall perchance do good but speak you on
you look as you had something more to say


albany

if there be more more woeful hold it in
for i am almost ready to dissolve
hearing of this


edgar

this would have seem a period
to such as love not sorrow but another
to amplify too much would make much more
and top extremity
whilst i was big in clamour came there in a man
who having seen me in my worst estate
shunn my abhorr society but then finding
who twas that so endured with his strong arms
he fastened on my neck and bellow out
as held burst heaven threw him on my father
told the most piteous tale of lear and him
that ever ear received which in recounting
his grief grew puissant and the strings of life
began to crack twice then the trumpets sounded
and there i left him tranced


albany

but who was this


edgar

kent sir the banish kent who in disguise
follow his enemy king and did him service
improper for a slave
enter a gentleman with a bloody knife


gentleman

help help o help


edgar

exeunt with a dead march




loves labours lost

act i
scene i the king of navarre park

enter ferdinand king of navarre biron longaville and dumain


ferdinand

let fame that all hunt after in their lives
live register upon our brazen tombs
and then grace us in the disgrace of death
when spite of cormorant devouring time
the endeavor of this present breath may buy
that honour which shall bate his scythe keen edge
and make us heirs of all eternity
therefore brave conquerors for so you are
that war against your own affections
and the huge army of the world desires 
our late edict shall strongly stand in force
navarre shall be the wonder of the world
our court shall be a little academe
still and contemplative in living art
you three biron dumain and longaville
have sworn for three years term to live with me
my fellow-scholars and to keep those statutes
that are recorded in this schedule here
your oaths are pass and now subscribe your names
that his own hand may strike his honour down
that violates the smallest branch herein
if you are arm to do as sworn to do
subscribe to your deep oaths and keep it too


longaville

i am resolved tis but a three years fast
the mind shall banquet though the body pine
fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits
make rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the wits


dumain

my loving lord dumain is mortified
the grosser manner of these world delights
he throws upon the gross world baser slaves
to love to wealth to pomp i pine and die
with all these living in philosophy


biron

i can but say their protestation over
so much dear liege i have already sworn
that is to live and study here three years
but there are other strict observances
as not to see a woman in that term
which i hope well is not enrolled there
and one day in a week to touch no food
and but one meal on every day beside
the which i hope is not enrolled there
and then to sleep but three hours in the night
and not be seen to wink of all the day 
when i was wont to think no harm all night
and make a dark night too of half the day 
which i hope well is not enrolled there
o these are barren tasks too hard to keep
not to see ladies study fast not sleep


ferdinand

your oath is pass to pass away from these


biron

let me say no my liege an if you please
i only swore to study with your grace
and stay here in your court for three years space


longaville

you swore to that biron and to the rest


biron

by yea and nay sir then i swore in jest
what is the end of study let me know


ferdinand

why that to know which else we should not know


biron

things hid and barr you mean from common sense


ferdinand

ay that is study godlike recompense


biron

come on then i will swear to study so
to know the thing i am forbid to know
as thus to study where i well may dine
when i to feast expressly am forbid
or study where to meet some mistress fine
when mistresses from common sense are hid
or having sworn too hard a keeping oath
study to break it and not break my troth
if study gain be thus and this be so
study knows that which yet it doth not know
swear me to this and i will neer say no


ferdinand

these be the stops that hinder study quite
and train our intellects to vain delight


biron

why all delights are vain but that most vain
which with pain purchased doth inherit pain
as painfully to pore upon a book
to seek the light of truth while truth the while
doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look
light seeking light doth light of light beguile
so ere you find where light in darkness lies
your light grows dark by losing of your eyes
study me how to please the eye indeed
by fixing it upon a fairer eye
who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed
and give him light that it was blinded by
study is like the heaven glorious sun
that will not be deep-search with saucy looks
small have continual plodders ever won
save base authority from others books
these earthly godfathers of heaven lights
that give a name to every fixed star
have no more profit of their shining nights
than those that walk and wot not what they are
too much to know is to know nought but fame
and every godfather can give a name


ferdinand

how well he read to reason against reading


dumain

proceeded well to stop all good proceeding


longaville

he weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding


biron

the spring is near when green geese are a-breeding


dumain

how follows that


biron

fit in his place and time


dumain

in reason nothing


biron

something then in rhyme


ferdinand

biron is like an envious sneaping frost
that bites the first-born infants of the spring


biron

well say i am why should proud summer boast
before the birds have any cause to sing
why should i joy in any abortive birth
at christmas i no more desire a rose
than wish a snow in may new-fangled mirth
but like of each thing that in season grows
so you to study now it is too late
climb oer the house to unlock the little gate


ferdinand

well sit you out go home biron adieu


biron

no my good lord i have sworn to stay with you
and though i have for barbarism spoke more
than for that angel knowledge you can say
yet confident ill keep what i have swore
and bide the penance of each three years day
give me the paper let me read the same
and to the strict decrees ill write my name


ferdinand

how well this yielding rescues thee from shame


biron

reads  item that no woman shall come within a
mile of my court hath this been proclaimed


longaville

four days ago


biron

let see the penalty
reads
on pain of losing her tongue who devised this penalty


longaville

marry that did i


biron

sweet lord and why


longaville

to fright them hence with that dread penalty


biron

a dangerous law against gentility
reads
item if any man be seen to talk with a woman
within the term of three years he shall endure such
public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise
this article my liege yourself must break
for well you know here comes in embassy
the french king daughter with yourself to speak 
a maid of grace and complete majesty 
about surrender up of aquitaine
to her decrepit sick and bedrid father
therefore this article is made in vain
or vainly comes the admired princess hither


ferdinand

what say you lords why this was quite forgot


biron

so study evermore is overshot
while it doth study to have what it would
it doth forget to do the thing it should
and when it hath the thing it hunteth most
tis won as towns with fire so won so lost


ferdinand

we must of force dispense with this decree
she must lie here on mere necessity


biron

necessity will make us all forsworn
three thousand times within this three years space
for every man with his affects is born
not by might master but by special grace
if i break faith this word shall speak for me
i am forsworn on mere necessity
so to the laws at large i write my name
subscribes
and he that breaks them in the least degree
stands in attainder of eternal shame
suggestions are to other as to me
but i believe although i seem so loath
i am the last that will last keep his oath
but is there no quick recreation granted


ferdinand

ay that there is our court you know is haunted
with a refined traveller of spain
a man in all the world new fashion planted
that hath a mint of phrases in his brain
one whom the music of his own vain tongue
doth ravish like enchanting harmony
a man of complements whom right and wrong
have chose as umpire of their mutiny
this child of fancy that armado hight
for interim to our studies shall relate
in high-born words the worth of many a knight
from tawny spain lost in the world debate
how you delight my lords i know not i
but i protest i love to hear him lie
and i will use him for my minstrelsy


biron

armado is a most illustrious wight
a man of fire-new words fashion own knight


longaville

costard the swain and he shall be our sport
and so to study three years is but short
enter dull with a letter and costard


dull

which is the duke own person


biron

this fellow what wouldst


dull

i myself reprehend his own person for i am his
grace tharborough but i would see his own person
in flesh and blood


biron

this is he


dull

signior arme arme commends you there villany
abroad this letter will tell you more


costard

sir the contempts thereof are as touching me


ferdinand

a letter from the magnificent armado


biron

how low soever the matter i hope in god for high words


longaville

a high hope for a low heaven god grant us patience


biron

to hear or forbear laughing


longaville

to hear meekly sir and to laugh moderately or to
forbear both


biron

well sir be it as the style shall give us cause to
climb in the merriness


costard

the matter is to me sir as concerning jaquenetta
the manner of it is i was taken with the manner


biron

in what manner


costard

in manner and form following sir all those three
i was seen with her in the manor-house sitting with
her upon the form and taken following her into the
park which put together is in manner and form
following now sir for the manner it is the
manner of a man to speak to a woman for the form 
in some form


biron

for the following sir


costard

as it shall follow in my correction and god defend
the right


ferdinand

will you hear this letter with attention


biron

as we would hear an oracle


costard

such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh


ferdinand

reads  great deputy the welkin vicegerent and
sole dominator of navarre my soul earth god
and body fostering patron


costard

not a word of costard yet


ferdinand

reads  o it is 


costard

it may be so but if he say it is so he is in
telling true but so


ferdinand

peace


costard

be to me and every man that dares not fight


ferdinand

no words


costard

of other men secrets i beseech you


ferdinand

reads  o it is besieged with sable-coloured
melancholy i did commend the black-oppressing humour
to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving
air and as i am a gentleman betook myself to
walk the time when about the sixth hour when
beasts most graze birds best peck and men sit down
to that nourishment which is called supper so much
for the time when now for the ground which which
i mean i walked upon it is y-cleped thy park then
for the place where where i mean i did encounter
that obscene and preposterous event that draweth
from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink which
here thou viewest beholdest surveyest or seest
but to the place where it standeth north-north-east
and by east from the west corner of thy curious-
knotted garden there did i see that low-spirited
swain that base minnow of thy mirth 


costard

me


ferdinand

reads  that unlettered small-knowing soul 


costard

me


ferdinand

reads  that shallow vassal 


costard

still me


ferdinand

reads  which as i remember hight costard 


costard

o me


ferdinand

reads  orted and consorted contrary to thy
established proclaimed edict and continent canon
which with o with but with this i passion to say
wherewith 


costard

with a wench


ferdinand

reads  with a child of our grandmother eve a

adriano de armado

why sadness is one and the self-same thing dear imp


moth

no no o lord sir no
don


adriano de armado

how canst thou part sadness and melancholy my
tender juvenal


moth

by a familiar demonstration of the working my tough senior
don


adriano de armado

why tough senior why tough senior


moth

why tender juvenal why tender juvenal
don


adriano de armado

i spoke it tender juvenal as a congruent epitheton
appertaining to thy young days which we may
nominate tender


moth

and i tough senior as an appertinent title to your
old time which we may name tough
don adriano de


armado

pretty and apt


moth

how mean you sir i pretty and my saying apt or
i apt and my saying pretty
don


adriano de armado

moth

little pretty because little wherefore apt
don


adriano de armado

and therefore apt because quick


moth

speak you this in my praise master
don


adriano de armado

in thy condign praise


moth

i will praise an eel with the same praise
don


adriano de armado

moth

don


adriano de armado

i do say thou art quick in answers thou heatest my blood


moth

i am answered sir
don


adriano de armado

i love not to be crossed


moth

aside  he speaks the mere contrary crosses love not him
don


adriano de armado

i have promised to study three years with the duke


moth

you may do it in an hour sir
don


adriano de armado

impossible


moth

how many is one thrice told
don


adriano de armado

i am ill at reckoning it fitteth the spirit of a tapster


moth

you are a gentleman and a gamester sir
don


adriano de armado

i confess both they are both the varnish of a
complete man


moth

then i am sure you know how much the gross sum of
deuce-ace amounts to
don


adriano de armado

it doth amount to one more than two


moth

which the base vulgar do call three
don


adriano de armado

true


moth

why sir is this such a piece of study now here
is three studied ere yell thrice wink and how
easy it is to put years to the word three and
study three years in two words the dancing horse
will tell you
don


adriano de armado

a most fine figure


moth

to prove you a cipher
don


adriano de armado

i will hereupon confess i am in love and as it is
base for a soldier to love so am i in love with a
base wench if drawing my sword against the humour
of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
thought of it i would take desire prisoner and
ransom him to any french courtier for a new-devised
courtesy i think scorn to sigh methinks i should
outswear cupid comfort me boy what great men
have been in love


moth

hercules master
don


adriano de armado

most sweet hercules more authority dear boy name
more and sweet my child let them be men of good
repute and carriage


moth

samson master he was a man of good carriage great
carriage for he carried the town-gates on his back
like a porter and he was in love
don


adriano de armado

o well-knit samson strong-jointed samson i do
excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
carrying gates i am in love too who was samson

moth

of all the four or the three or the two or one of the four
don


adriano de armado

tell me precisely of what complexion


moth

of the sea-water green sir
don


adriano de armado

is that one of the four complexions


moth

as i have read sir and the best of them too
don


adriano de armado

green indeed is the colour of lovers but to have a
love of that colour methinks samson had small reason
for it he surely affected her for her wit


moth

it was so sir for she had a green wit
don


adriano de armado

my love is most immaculate white and red


moth

most maculate thoughts master are masked under
such colours
don


adriano de armado

define define well-educated infant


moth

my father wit and my mother tongue assist me
don


adriano de armado

sweet invocation of a child most pretty and
pathetical


moth

if she be made of white and red
her faults will neer be known
for blushing cheeks by faults are bred
and fears by pale white shown
then if she fear or be to blame
by this you shall not know
for still her cheeks possess the same
which native she doth owe
a dangerous rhyme master against the reason of
white and red
don


adriano de armado

is there not a ballad boy of the king and the beggar


moth

the world was very guilty of such a ballad some
three ages since but i think now tis not to be
found or if it were it would neither serve for
the writing nor the tune
don


adriano de armado

i will have that subject newly writ oer that i may
example my digression by some mighty precedent
boy i do love that country girl that i took in the
park with the rational hind costard she deserves well


moth

aside  to be whipped and yet a better love than
my master
don


adriano de armado

sing boy my spirit grows heavy in love


moth

and that great marvel loving a light wench
don


adriano de armado

moth

dull

sir the duke pleasure is that you keep costard
safe and you must suffer him to take no delight
nor no penance but a must fast three days a week

costard

well if ever i do see the merry days of desolation
that i have seen some shall see


moth

what shall some see


costard

nay nothing master moth but what they look upon
it is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
words and therefore i will say nothing i thank
god i have as little patience as another man and
therefore i can be quiet
exeunt moth and costard
don


adriano de armado

i do affect the very ground which is base where
her shoe which is baser guided by her foot which
is basest doth tread i shall be forsworn which
is a great argument of falsehood if i love and
how can that be true love which is falsely
attempted love is a familiar love is a devil
there is no evil angel but love yet was samson so
tempted and he had an excellent strength yet was
solomon so seduced and he had a very good wit
cupid butt-shaft is too hard for hercules club
and therefore too much odds for a spaniard rapier
the first and second cause will not serve my turn
the passado he respects not the duello he regards
not his disgrace is to be called boy but his
glory is to subdue men adieu valour rust rapier
be still drum for your manager is in love yea
he loveth assist me some extemporal god of rhyme
for i am sure i shall turn sonnet devise wit
write pen for i am for whole volumes in folio

act ii
scene i the same

enter the princess of france rosaline maria katharine boyet lords and other attendants


boyet

now madam summon up your dearest spirits
consider who the king your father sends
to whom he sends and what his embassy
yourself held precious in the world esteem
to parley with the sole inheritor
of all perfections that a man may owe
matchless navarre the plea of no less weight
than aquitaine a dowry for a queen
be now as prodigal of all dear grace
as nature was in making graces dear
when she did starve the general world beside
and prodigally gave them all to you


princess

good lord boyet my beauty though but mean
needs not the painted flourish of your praise
beauty is bought by judgement of the eye
not utter by base sale of chapmen tongues
i am less proud to hear you tell my worth
than you much willing to be counted wise
in spending your wit in the praise of mine
but now to task the tasker good boyet
you are not ignorant all-telling fame
doth noise abroad navarre hath made a vow
till painful study shall outwear three years
no woman may approach his silent court
therefore to seemeth it a needful course
before we enter his forbidden gates
to know his pleasure and in that behalf
bold of your worthiness we single you
as our best-moving fair solicitor
tell him the daughter of the king of france
on serious business craving quick dispatch
importunes personal conference with his grace
haste signify so much while we attend
like humble-visaged suitors his high will


boyet

proud of employment willingly i go


princess

all pride is willing pride and yours is so
exit boyet
who are the votaries my loving lords
that are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke


first lord

lord longaville is one


princess

know you the man


maria

i know him madam at a marriage-feast
between lord perigort and the beauteous heir
of jaques falconbridge solemnized
in normandy saw i this longaville
a man of sovereign parts he is esteem
well fitted in arts glorious in arms
nothing becomes him ill that he would well
the only soil of his fair virtue gloss
if virtue gloss will stain with any soil
is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will
whose edge hath power to cut whose will still wills
it should none spare that come within his power


princess

some merry mocking lord belike ist so


maria

they say so most that most his humours know


princess

such short-lived wits do wither as they grow
who are the rest


katharine

the young dumain a well-accomplished youth
of all that virtue love for virtue loved
most power to do most harm least knowing ill
for he hath wit to make an ill shape good
and shape to win grace though he had no wit
i saw him at the duke alencon once
and much too little of that good i saw
is my report to his great worthiness


rosaline

another of these students at that time
was there with him if i have heard a truth
biron they call him but a merrier man
within the limit of becoming mirth
i never spent an hour talk withal
his eye begets occasion for his wit
for every object that the one doth catch
the other turns to a mirth-moving jest
which his fair tongue conceit expositor
delivers in such apt and gracious words
that aged ears play truant at his tales
and younger hearings are quite ravished
so sweet and voluble is his discourse


princess

god bless my ladies are they all in love
that every one her own hath garnished
with such bedecking ornaments of praise


first lord

here comes boyet
re-enter boyet


princess

now what admittance lord


boyet

navarre had notice of your fair approach
and he and his competitors in oath
were all address to meet you gentle lady
before i came marry thus much i have learnt
he rather means to lodge you in the field
like one that comes here to besiege his court
than seek a dispensation for his oath
to let you enter his unpeopled house
here comes navarre
enter ferdinand longaville dumain biron and attendants


ferdinand

fair princess welcome to the court of navarre


princess

fair i give you back again and welcome i have
not yet the roof of this court is too high to be
yours and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine


ferdinand

you shall be welcome madam to my court


princess

i will be welcome then conduct me thither


ferdinand

hear me dear lady i have sworn an oath


princess

our lady help my lord hell be forsworn


ferdinand

not for the world fair madam by my will


princess

why will shall break it will and nothing else


ferdinand

your ladyship is ignorant what it is


princess

were my lord so his ignorance were wise
where now his knowledge must prove ignorance
i hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping
tis deadly sin to keep that oath my lord
and sin to break it
but pardon me i am too sudden-bold
to teach a teacher ill beseemeth me
vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming
and suddenly resolve me in my suit


ferdinand

madam i will if suddenly i may


princess

you will the sooner that i were away
for youll prove perjured if you make me stay


biron

did not i dance with you in brabant once


rosaline

did not i dance with you in brabant once


biron

i know you did


rosaline

how needless was it then to ask the question


biron

you must not be so quick


rosaline

tis long of you that spur me with such questions


biron

your wit too hot it speeds too fast twill tire


rosaline

not till it leave the rider in the mire


biron

what time o day


rosaline

the hour that fools should ask


biron

now fair befall your mask


rosaline

fair fall the face it covers


biron

and send you many lovers


rosaline

amen so you be none


biron

nay then will i be gone


ferdinand

madam your father here doth intimate
the payment of a hundred thousand crowns
being but the one half of an entire sum
disbursed by my father in his wars
but say that he or we as neither have
received that sum yet there remains unpaid
a hundred thousand more in surety of the which
one part of aquitaine is bound to us
although not valued to the money worth
if then the king your father will restore
but that one half which is unsatisfied
we will give up our right in aquitaine
and hold fair friendship with his majesty
but that it seems he little purposeth
for here he doth demand to have repaid
a hundred thousand crowns and not demands
on payment of a hundred thousand crowns
to have his title live in aquitaine
which we much rather had depart withal
and have the money by our father lent
than aquitaine so gelded as it is
dear princess were not his requests so far
from reason yielding your fair self should make
a yielding gainst some reason in my breast
and go well satisfied to france again


princess

you do the king my father too much wrong
and wrong the reputation of your name
in so unseeming to confess receipt
of that which hath so faithfully been paid


ferdinand

i do protest i never heard of it
and if you prove it ill repay it back
or yield up aquitaine


princess

we arrest your word
boyet you can produce acquittances
for such a sum from special officers
of charles his father


ferdinand

satisfy me so


boyet

so please your grace the packet is not come
where that and other specialties are bound
to-morrow you shall have a sight of them


ferdinand

it shall suffice me at which interview
all liberal reason i will yield unto
meantime receive such welcome at my hand
as honour without breach of honour may
make tender of to thy true worthiness
you may not come fair princess in my gates
but here without you shall be so received
as you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart
though so denied fair harbour in my house
your own good thoughts excuse me and farewell
to-morrow shall we visit you again


princess

sweet health and fair desires consort your grace


ferdinand

thy own wish wish i thee in every place
exit


biron

lady i will commend you to mine own heart


rosaline

pray you do my commendations i would be glad to see it


biron

i would you heard it groan


rosaline

is the fool sick


biron

sick at the heart


rosaline

alack let it blood


biron

would that do it good


rosaline

my physic says ay

boyet

she hath but one for herself to desire that were a shame


longaville

boyet

her mother i have heard


longaville

god blessing on your beard


boyet

good sir be not offended
she is an heir of falconbridge


longaville

nay my choler is ended

boyet

exit longaville


biron

boyet

rosaline by good hap


biron

is she wedded or no


boyet

biron

you are welcome sir adieu


boyet

farewell to me sir and welcome to you
exit biron


maria

that last is biron the merry madcap lord
not a word with him but a jest


boyet

and every jest but a word


princess

it was well done of you to take him at his word


boyet

i was as willing to grapple as he was to board


maria

two hot sheeps marry


boyet

and wherefore not ships
no sheep sweet lamb unless we feed on your lips


maria

you sheep and i pasture shall that finish the jest


boyet

so you grant pasture for me
offering to kiss her


maria

not so gentle beast
my lips are no common though several they be


boyet

belonging to whom


maria

to my fortunes and me


princess

good wits will be jangling but gentles agree
this civil war of wits were much better used
on navarre and his book-men for here tis abused


boyet

if my observation which very seldom lies
by the heart still rhetoric disclosed with eyes
deceive me not now navarre is infected


princess

with what


boyet

with that which we lovers entitle affected


princess

your reason


boyet

why all his behaviors did make their retire
to the court of his eye peeping thorough desire
his heart like an agate with your print impress
proud with his form in his eye pride express
his tongue all impatient to speak and not see
did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be
all senses to that sense did make their repair
to feel only looking on fairest of fair
methought all his senses were lock in his eye
as jewels in crystal for some prince to buy
who tendering their own worth from where they were glass
did point you to buy them along as you pass
his face own margent did quote such amazes
that all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes
ill give you aquitaine and all that is his
an you give him for my sake but one loving kiss


princess

come to our pavilion boyet is disposed


boyet

but to speak that in words which his eye hath
disclosed
i only have made a mouth of his eye
by adding a tongue which i know will not lie


rosaline

thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully


maria

he is cupid grandfather and learns news of him


rosaline

then was venus like her mother for her father is but grim


boyet

do you hear my mad wenches


maria

no


boyet

what then do you see


rosaline

ay our way to be gone


boyet

you are too hard for me

the tongue end canary to it with your feet humour

swallowed love with singing love sometime through
the nose as if you snuffed up love by smelling
love with your hat penthouse-like oer the shop of
your eyes with your arms crossed on your thin-belly
doublet like a rabbit on a spit or your hands in
your pocket like a man after the old painting and
keep not too long in one tune but a snip and away

these and make them men of note do you note

and i forsooth in love i that have been love whip
a very beadle to a humorous sigh
a critic nay a night-watch constable
a domineering pedant oer the boy
than whom no mortal so magnificent
this whimpled whining purblind wayward boy
this senior-junior giant-dwarf dan cupid
regent of love-rhymes lord of folded arms
the anointed sovereign of sighs and groans
liege of all loiterers and malcontents
dread prince of plackets king of codpieces
sole imperator and great general
of trotting paritors o my little heart 
and i to be a corporal of his field
and wear his colours like a tumbler hoop
what i i love i sue i seek a wife
a woman that is like a german clock
still a-repairing ever out of frame
and never going aright being a watch
but being watch that it may still go right
nay to be perjured which is worst of all
and among three to love the worst of all
a wightly wanton with a velvet brow
with two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes
ay and by heaven one that will do the deed
though argus were her eunuch and her guard
and i to sigh for her to watch for her
to pray for her go to it is a plague
that cupid will impose for my neglect
of his almighty dreadful little might
well i will love write sigh pray sue and groan
some men must love my lady and some joan

act iv
scene i the same

enter the princess and her train a forester boyet rosaline maria and katharine


princess

was that the king that spurred his horse so hard
against the steep uprising of the hill


boyet

i know not but i think it was not he


princess

whoeer a was a show a mounting mind
well lords to-day we shall have our dispatch
on saturday we will return to france
then forester my friend where is the bush
that we must stand and play the murderer in


forester

hereby upon the edge of yonder coppice
a stand where you may make the fairest shoot


princess

i thank my beauty i am fair that shoot
and thereupon thou speak the fairest shoot


forester

pardon me madam for i meant not so


princess

what what first praise me and again say no
o short-lived pride not fair alack for woe


forester

yes madam fair


princess

nay never paint me now
where fair is not praise cannot mend the brow
here good my glass take this for telling true
fair payment for foul words is more than due


forester

nothing but fair is that which you inherit


princess

see see my beauty will be saved by merit
o heresy in fair fit for these days
a giving hand though foul shall have fair praise
but come the bow now mercy goes to kill
and shooting well is then accounted ill
thus will i save my credit in the shoot
not wounding pity would not let me dot
if wounding then it was to show my skill
that more for praise than purpose meant to kill
and out of question so it is sometimes
glory grows guilty of detested crimes
when for fame sake for praise an outward part
we bend to that the working of the heart
as i for praise alone now seek to spill
the poor deer blood that my heart means no ill


boyet

do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
only for praise sake when they strive to be
lords oer their lords


princess

only for praise and praise we may afford
to any lady that subdues a lord

commiseration on thy heroical vassal the

eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
zenelophon and he it was that might rightly say
veni vidi vici which to annothanize in the
vulgar o base and obscure vulgar videlicet he
came saw and overcame he came one saw two
overcame three who came the king why did he
come to see why did he see to overcome to
whom came he to the beggar what saw he the
beggar who overcame he the beggar the
conclusion is victory on whose side the king
the captive is enriched on whose side the
beggar the catastrophe is a nuptial on whose
side the king no on both in one or one in
both i am the king for so stands the comparison
thou the beggar for so witnesseth thy lowliness
shall i command thy love i may shall i enforce
thy love i could shall i entreat thy love i

for tittles titles for thyself me thus
expecting thy reply i profane my lips on thy foot
my eyes on thy picture and my heart on thy every
part thine in the dearest design of industry

scene ii the same

enter holofernes sir nathaniel and dull


sir nathaniel

very reverend sport truly and done in the testimony
of a good conscience


holofernes

the deer was as you know sanguis in blood ripe
as the pomewater who now hangeth like a jewel in
the ear of caelo the sky the welkin the heaven
and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra
the soil the land the earth


sir nathaniel

truly master holofernes the epithets are sweetly
varied like a scholar at the least but sir i
assure ye it was a buck of the first head


holofernes

sir nathaniel haud credo


dull

twas not a haud credo twas a pricket


holofernes

most barbarous intimation yet a kind of
insinuation as it were in via in way of
explication facere as it were replication or
rather ostentare to show as it were his
inclination after his undressed unpolished
uneducated unpruned untrained or rather
unlettered or ratherest unconfirmed fashion to
insert again my haud credo for a deer


dull

i said the deer was not a haud credo twas a pricket


holofernes

twice-sod simplicity his coctus
o thou monster ignorance how deformed dost thou look


sir nathaniel

sir he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred
in a book he hath not eat paper as it were he
hath not drunk ink his intellect is not
replenished he is only an animal only sensible in
the duller parts
and such barren plants are set before us that we
thankful should be
which we of taste and feeling are for those parts that
do fructify in us more than he
for as it would ill become me to be vain indiscreet or a fool
so were there a patch set on learning to see him in a school
but omne bene say i being of an old father mind
many can brook the weather that love not the wind


dull

you two are book-men can you tell me by your wit
what was a month old at cain birth that not five
weeks old as yet


holofernes

dictynna goodman dull dictynna goodman dull


dull

what is dictynna


sir nathaniel

a title to phoebe to luna to the moon


holofernes

the moon was a month old when adam was no more
and raught not to five weeks when he came to
five-score
the allusion holds in the exchange


dull

tis true indeed the collusion holds in the exchange


holofernes

god comfort thy capacity i say the allusion holds
in the exchange


dull

and i say the pollusion holds in the exchange for
the moon is never but a month old and i say beside
that twas a pricket that the princess killed


holofernes

sir nathaniel will you hear an extemporal epitaph
on the death of the deer and to humour the
ignorant call i the deer the princess killed a pricket


sir nathaniel

perge good master holofernes perge so it shall
please you to abrogate scurrility


holofernes

i will something affect the letter for it argues facility
the preyful princess pierced and prick a pretty
pleasing pricket
some say a sore but not a sore till now made
sore with shooting
the dogs did yell put l to sore then sorel jumps
from thicket
or pricket sore or else sorel the people fall a-hooting
if sore be sore then l to sore makes fifty sores
one sorel
of one sore i an hundred make by adding but one more l


sir nathaniel

a rare talent


dull

aside  if a talent be a claw look how he claws
him with a talent


holofernes

this is a gift that i have simple simple a
foolish extravagant spirit full of forms figures
shapes objects ideas apprehensions motions
revolutions these are begot in the ventricle of
memory nourished in the womb of pia mater and
delivered upon the mellowing of occasion but the
gift is good in those in whom it is acute and i am
thankful for it


sir nathaniel

sir i praise the lord for you and so may my
parishioners for their sons are well tutored by
you and their daughters profit very greatly under
you you are a good member of the commonwealth


holofernes

mehercle if their sons be ingenuous they shall
want no instruction if their daughters be capable
i will put it to them but vir sapit qui pauca
loquitur a soul feminine saluteth us
enter jaquenetta and costard


jaquenetta

god give you good morrow master parson


holofernes

master parson quasi pers-on an if one should be
pierced which is the one


costard

marry master schoolmaster he that is likest to a hogshead


holofernes

piercing a hogshead a good lustre of conceit in a
tuft of earth fire enough for a flint pearl enough
for a swine tis pretty it is well


jaquenetta

good master parson be so good as read me this
letter it was given me by costard and sent me
from don armado i beseech you read it


holofernes

fauste precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra
ruminat and so forth ah good old mantuan i
may speak of thee as the traveller doth of venice
venetia venetia
chi non ti vede non ti pretia
old mantuan old mantuan who understandeth thee
not loves thee not ut re sol la mi fa
under pardon sir what are the contents or rather
as horace says in his what my soul verses


sir nathaniel

ay sir and very learned


holofernes

let me hear a staff a stanze a verse lege domine


sir nathaniel

reads
if love make me forsworn how shall i swear to love
ah never faith could hold if not to beauty vow
though to myself forsworn to thee ill faithful prove
those thoughts to me were oaks to thee like
osiers bow
study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes
where all those pleasures live that art would
comprehend
if knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice
well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend
all ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder
which is to me some praise that i thy parts admire
thy eye jove lightning bears thy voice his dreadful thunder
which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire
celestial as thou art o pardon love this wrong
that sings heaven praise with such an earthly tongue


holofernes

you find not the apostraphas and so miss the
accent let me supervise the canzonet here are
only numbers ratified but for the elegancy
facility and golden cadence of poesy caret
ovidius naso was the man and why indeed naso
but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of
fancy the jerks of invention imitari is nothing
so doth the hound his master the ape his keeper
the tired horse his rider but damosella virgin
was this directed to you


jaquenetta

ay sir from one monsieur biron one of the strange
queen lords


holofernes

i will overglance the superscript to the
snow-white hand of the most beauteous lady
rosaline i will look again on the intellect of
the letter for the nomination of the party writing
to the person written unto your ladyship in all
desired employment biron sir nathaniel this
biron is one of the votaries with the king and here
he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger
queen which accidentally or by the way of
progression hath miscarried trip and go my

king it may concern much stay not thy
compliment i forgive thy duty adieu

religiously and as a certain father saith 


holofernes

colours but to return to the verses did they
please you sir nathaniel


sir nathaniel

marvellous well for the pen


holofernes

of mine where if before repast it shall please
you to gratify the table with a grace i will on my
privilege i have with the parents of the foresaid
child or pupil undertake your ben venuto where i
will prove those verses to be very unlearned
neither savouring of poetry wit nor invention i
beseech your society


sir nathaniel

and thank you too for society saith the text is
the happiness of life


holofernes

and certes the text most infallibly concludes it
to dull
sir i do invite you too you shall not
say me nay pauca verba away the gentles are at
their game and we will to our recreation
exeunt

proved wit by the lord this love is as mad as
ajax it kills sheep it kills me i a sheep
well proved again o my side i will not love if
i do hang me i faith i will not o but her
eye by this light but for her eye i would not
love her yes for her two eyes well i do nothing

and to be melancholy and here is part of my rhyme
and here my melancholy well she hath one o my

stands aside
enter ferdinand with a paper


ferdinand

ay me


biron

aside  shot by heaven proceed sweet cupid
thou hast thumped him with thy bird-bolt under the
left pap in faith secrets


ferdinand

reads
so sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
to those fresh morning drops upon the rose
as thy eye-beams when their fresh rays have smote
the night of dew that on my cheeks down flows
nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
through the transparent bosom of the deep
as doth thy face through tears of mine give light
thou shinest in every tear that i do weep
no drop but as a coach doth carry thee
so ridest thou triumphing in my woe
do but behold the tears that swell in me
and they thy glory through my grief will show
but do not love thyself then thou wilt keep
my tears for glasses and still make me weep
o queen of queens how far dost thou excel
no thought can think nor tongue of mortal tell
how shall she know my griefs ill drop the paper
sweet leaves shade folly who is he comes here
steps aside
what longaville and reading listen ear


biron

now in thy likeness one more fool appear
enter longaville with a paper


longaville

ay me i am forsworn


biron

why he comes in like a perjure wearing papers


ferdinand

in love i hope sweet fellowship in shame


biron

one drunkard loves another of the name


longaville

am i the first that have been perjured so


biron

i could put thee in comfort not by two that i know
thou makest the triumviry the corner-cap of society
the shape of love tyburn that hangs up simplicity


longaville

i fear these stubborn lines lack power to move
o sweet maria empress of my love
these numbers will i tear and write in prose


biron

o rhymes are guards on wanton cupid hose
disfigure not his slop


longaville

this same shall go
reads
did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye
gainst whom the world cannot hold argument
persuade my heart to this false perjury
vows for thee broke deserve not punishment
a woman i forswore but i will prove
thou being a goddess i forswore not thee
my vow was earthly thou a heavenly love
thy grace being gain cures all disgrace in me
vows are but breath and breath a vapour is
then thou fair sun which on my earth dost shine
exhalest this vapour-vow in thee it is
if broken then it is no fault of mine
if by me broke what fool is not so wise
to lose an oath to win a paradise


biron

this is the liver-vein which makes flesh a deity
a green goose a goddess pure pure idolatry
god amend us god amend we are much out o the way


longaville

by whom shall i send this company stay
steps aside


biron

all hid all hid an old infant play
like a demigod here sit i in the sky
and wretched fools secrets heedfully oereye
more sacks to the mill o heavens i have my wish
enter dumain with a paper
dumain transform four woodcocks in a dish


dumain

o most divine kate


biron

o most profane coxcomb


dumain

by heaven the wonder in a mortal eye


biron

by earth she is not corporal there you lie


dumain

her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted


biron

an amber-colour raven was well noted


dumain

as upright as the cedar


biron

stoop i say
her shoulder is with child


dumain

as fair as day


biron

ay as some days but then no sun must shine


dumain

o that i had my wish


longaville

and i had mine


ferdinand

and i mine too good lord


biron

amen so i had mine is not that a good word


dumain

i would forget her but a fever she
reigns in my blood and will remember be


biron

a fever in your blood why then incision
would let her out in saucers sweet misprision


dumain

once more ill read the ode that i have writ


biron

once more ill mark how love can vary wit


dumain

reads
on a day alack the day 
love whose month is ever may
spied a blossom passing fair
playing in the wanton air
through the velvet leaves the wind
all unseen can passage find
that the lover sick to death
wish himself the heaven breath
air quoth he thy cheeks may blow
air would i might triumph so
but alack my hand is sworn
neer to pluck thee from thy thorn
vow alack for youth unmeet
youth so apt to pluck a sweet
do not call it sin in me
that i am forsworn for thee
thou for whom jove would swear
juno but an ethiope were
and deny himself for jove
turning mortal for thy love
this will i send and something else more plain
that shall express my true love fasting pain
o would the king biron and longaville
were lovers too ill to example ill
would from my forehead wipe a perjured note
for none offend where all alike do dote


longaville

advancing  dumain thy love is far from charity
you may look pale but i should blush i know
to be oerheard and taken napping so


ferdinand

advancing  come sir you blush as his your case is such
you chide at him offending twice as much
you do not love maria longaville
did never sonnet for her sake compile
nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
his loving bosom to keep down his heart
i have been closely shrouded in this bush
and mark you both and for you both did blush
i heard your guilty rhymes observed your fashion
saw sighs reek from you noted well your passion
ay me says one o jove the other cries
one her hairs were gold crystal the other eyes
to longaville
you would for paradise break faith and troth
to dumain
and jove for your love would infringe an oath
what will biron say when that he shall hear
faith so infringed which such zeal did swear
how will he scorn how will he spend his wit
how will he triumph leap and laugh at it
for all the wealth that ever i did see
i would not have him know so much by me


biron

now step i forth to whip hypocrisy
advancing
ah good my liege i pray thee pardon me
good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove
these worms for loving that art most in love
your eyes do make no coaches in your tears
there is no certain princess that appears
youll not be perjured tis a hateful thing
tush none but minstrels like of sonneting
but are you not ashamed nay are you not
all three of you to be thus much oershot
you found his mote the king your mote did see
but i a beam do find in each of three
o what a scene of foolery have i seen
of sighs of groans of sorrow and of teen
o me with what strict patience have i sat
to see a king transformed to a gnat
to see great hercules whipping a gig
and profound solomon to tune a jig
and nestor play at push-pin with the boys
and critic timon laugh at idle toys
where lies thy grief o tell me good dumain
and gentle longaville where lies thy pain
and where my liege all about the breast
a caudle ho


ferdinand

too bitter is thy jest
are we betray thus to thy over-view


biron

not you to me but i betray by you
i that am honest i that hold it sin
to break the vow i am engaged in
i am betray by keeping company
with men like men of inconstancy
when shall you see me write a thing in rhyme
or groan for love or spend a minute time
in pruning me when shall you hear that i
will praise a hand a foot a face an eye
a gait a state a brow a breast a waist
a leg a limb


ferdinand

soft whither away so fast
a true man or a thief that gallops so


biron

i post from love good lover let me go
enter jaquenetta and costard


jaquenetta

god bless the king


ferdinand

what present hast thou there


costard

some certain treason


ferdinand

what makes treason here


costard

nay it makes nothing sir


ferdinand

if it mar nothing neither
the treason and you go in peace away together


jaquenetta

i beseech your grace let this letter be read
our parson misdoubts it twas treason he said


ferdinand

biron read it over
giving him the paper
where hadst thou it


jaquenetta

of costard


ferdinand

where hadst thou it


costard

of dun adramadio dun adramadio
biron tears the letter


ferdinand

how now what is in you why dost thou tear it


biron

a toy my liege a toy your grace needs not fear it


longaville

it did move him to passion and therefore let hear it


dumain

it is biron writing and here is his name
gathering up the pieces


biron

to costard  ah you whoreson loggerhead you were
born to do me shame
guilty my lord guilty i confess i confess


ferdinand

what


biron

that you three fools lack me fool to make up the mess
he he and you and you my liege and i
are pick-purses in love and we deserve to die
o dismiss this audience and i shall tell you more


dumain

now the number is even


biron

true true we are four
will these turtles be gone


ferdinand

hence sirs away


costard

walk aside the true folk and let the traitors stay
exeunt costard and jaquenetta


biron

sweet lords sweet lovers o let us embrace
as true we are as flesh and blood can be
the sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face
young blood doth not obey an old decree
we cannot cross the cause why we were born
therefore of all hands must we be forsworn


ferdinand

what did these rent lines show some love of thine


biron

did they quoth you who sees the heavenly rosaline
that like a rude and savage man of inde
at the first opening of the gorgeous east
bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
kisses the base ground with obedient breast
what peremptory eagle-sighted eye
dares look upon the heaven of her brow
that is not blinded by her majesty


ferdinand

what zeal what fury hath inspired thee now
my love her mistress is a gracious moon
she an attending star scarce seen a light


biron

my eyes are then no eyes nor i biron
o but for my love day would turn to night
of all complexions the cull sovereignty
do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek
where several worthies make one dignity
where nothing wants that want itself doth seek
lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues 
fie painted rhetoric o she needs it not
to things of sale a seller praise belongs
she passes praise then praise too short doth blot
a wither hermit five-score winters worn
might shake off fifty looking in her eye
beauty doth varnish age as if new-born
and gives the crutch the cradle infancy
o tis the sun that maketh all things shine


ferdinand

by heaven thy love is black as ebony


biron

is ebony like her o wood divine
a wife of such wood were felicity
o who can give an oath where is a book
that i may swear beauty doth beauty lack
if that she learn not of her eye to look
no face is fair that is not full so black


ferdinand

o paradox black is the badge of hell
the hue of dungeons and the suit of night
and beauty crest becomes the heavens well


biron

devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light
o if in black my lady brows be deck
it mourns that painting and usurping hair
should ravish doters with a false aspect
and therefore is she born to make black fair
her favour turns the fashion of the days
for native blood is counted painting now
and therefore red that would avoid dispraise
paints itself black to imitate her brow


dumain

to look like her are chimney-sweepers black


longaville

and since her time are colliers counted bright


ferdinand

and ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack


dumain

dark needs no candles now for dark is light


biron

your mistresses dare never come in rain
for fear their colours should be wash away


ferdinand

twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain
ill find a fairer face not wash to-day


biron

ill prove her fair or talk till doomsday here


ferdinand

no devil will fright thee then so much as she


dumain

i never knew man hold vile stuff so dear


longaville

look here thy love my foot and her face see


biron

o if the streets were paved with thine eyes
her feet were much too dainty for such tread


dumain

o vile then as she goes what upward lies
the street should see as she walk overhead


ferdinand

but what of this are we not all in love


biron

nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn


ferdinand

then leave this chat and good biron now prove
our loving lawful and our faith not torn


dumain

ay marry there some flattery for this evil


longaville

some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil

some salve for perjury


biron

tis more than need
have at you then affection men at arms
consider what you first did swear unto
to fast to study and to see no woman
flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth
say can you fast your stomachs are too young
and abstinence engenders maladies
and where that you have vow to study lords
in that each of you have forsworn his book
can you still dream and pore and thereon look
for when would you my lord or you or you
have found the ground of study excellence
without the beauty of a woman face
from women eyes this doctrine i derive  they are the ground the books the academes from whence doth spring the true promethean fire
why universal plodding poisons up
the nimble spirits in the arteries
as motion and long-during action tires
the sinewy vigour of the traveller
now for not looking on a woman face
you have in that forsworn the use of eyes
and study too the causer of your vow
for where is any author in the world
teaches such beauty as a woman eye
learning is but an adjunct to ourself
and where we are our learning likewise is
then when ourselves we see in ladies eyes
do we not likewise see our learning there
o we have made a vow to study lords
and in that vow we have forsworn our books
for when would you my liege or you or you
in leaden contemplation have found out
such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
of beauty tutors have enrich you with
other slow arts entirely keep the brain
and therefore finding barren practisers
scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil
but love first learned in a lady eyes
lives not alone immured in the brain
but with the motion of all elements
courses as swift as thought in every power
and gives to every power a double power
above their functions and their offices
it adds a precious seeing to the eye
a lover eyes will gaze an eagle blind
a lover ear will hear the lowest sound
when the suspicious head of theft is stopp
love feeling is more soft and sensible
than are the tender horns of cockl snails
love tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste
for valour is not love a hercules
still climbing trees in the hesperides
subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical
as bright apollo lute strung with his hair
and when love speaks the voice of all the gods
makes heaven drowsy with the harmony
never durst poet touch a pen to write
until his ink were temper with love sighs
o then his lines would ravish savage ears
and plant in tyrants mild humility
from women eyes this doctrine i derive
they sparkle still the right promethean fire
they are the books the arts the academes
that show contain and nourish all the world
else none at all in ought proves excellent
then fools you were these women to forswear
or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools
for wisdom sake a word that all men love
or for love sake a word that loves all men
or for men sake the authors of these women
or women sake by whom we men are men
let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves
or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths
it is religion to be thus forsworn
for charity itself fulfills the law
and who can sever love from charity


ferdinand

saint cupid then and soldiers to the field


biron

advance your standards and upon them lords
pell-mell down with them but be first advised
in conflict that you get the sun of them


longaville

now to plain-dealing lay these glozes by
shall we resolve to woo these girls of france


ferdinand

and win them too therefore let us devise
some entertainment for them in their tents


biron

first from the park let us conduct them thither
then homeward every man attach the hand
of his fair mistress in the afternoon
we will with some strange pastime solace them
such as the shortness of the time can shape
for revels dances masks and merry hours
forerun fair love strewing her way with flowers


ferdinand

away away no time shall be omitted
that will betime and may by us be fitted


biron

allons allons sow cockle reap no corn
and justice always whirls in equal measure
light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn
if so our copper buys no better treasure

scene ii the same

enter the princess katharine rosaline and maria


princess

sweet hearts we shall be rich ere we depart
if fairings come thus plentifully in
a lady wall about with diamonds
look you what i have from the loving king


rosaline

madame came nothing else along with that


princess

nothing but this yes as much love in rhyme
as would be cramm up in a sheet of paper
writ o both sides the leaf margent and all
that he was fain to seal on cupid name


rosaline

that was the way to make his godhead wax
for he hath been five thousand years a boy


katharine

ay and a shrewd unhappy gallows too


rosaline

youll neer be friends with him a kill your sister


katharine

he made her melancholy sad and heavy
and so she died had she been light like you
of such a merry nimble stirring spirit
she might ha been a grandam ere she died
and so may you for a light heart lives long


rosaline

what your dark meaning mouse of this light word


katharine

a light condition in a beauty dark


rosaline

we need more light to find your meaning out


katharine

youll mar the light by taking it in snuff
therefore ill darkly end the argument


rosaline

look what you do you do it still i the dark


katharine

so do not you for you are a light wench


rosaline

indeed i weigh not you and therefore light


katharine

you weigh me not o that you care not for me


rosaline

great reason for past cure is still past care


princess

well bandied both a set of wit well play
but rosaline you have a favour too
who sent it and what is it


rosaline

i would you knew
an if my face were but as fair as yours
my favour were as great be witness this
nay i have verses too i thank biron
the numbers true and were the numbering too
i were the fairest goddess on the ground
i am compared to twenty thousand fairs
o he hath drawn my picture in his letter


princess

any thing like


rosaline

much in the letters nothing in the praise


princess

beauteous as ink a good conclusion


katharine

fair as a text b in a copy-book


rosaline

ware pencils ho let me not die your debtor
my red dominical my golden letter
o that your face were not so full of o


katharine

a pox of that jest and i beshrew all shrows


princess

but katharine what was sent to you from fair dumain


katharine

madam this glove


princess

did he not send you twain


katharine

yes madam and moreover
some thousand verses of a faithful lover
a huge translation of hypocrisy
vilely compiled profound simplicity


maria

this and these pearls to me sent longaville
the letter is too long by half a mile


princess

i think no less dost thou not wish in heart
the chain were longer and the letter short


maria

ay or i would these hands might never part


princess

we are wise girls to mock our lovers so


rosaline

they are worse fools to purchase mocking so
that same biron ill torture ere i go
o that i knew he were but in by the week
how i would make him fawn and beg and seek
and wait the season and observe the times
and spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
and shape his service wholly to my hests
and make him proud to make me proud that jests
so perttaunt-like would i oersway his state
that he should be my fool and i his fate


princess

none are so surely caught when they are catch
as wit turn fool folly in wisdom hatch
hath wisdom warrant and the help of school
and wit own grace to grace a learned fool


rosaline

the blood of youth burns not with such excess
as gravity revolt to wantonness


maria

folly in fools bears not so strong a note
as foolery in the wise when wit doth dote
since all the power thereof it doth apply
to prove by wit worth in simplicity


princess

here comes boyet and mirth is in his face
enter boyet


boyet

o i am stabb with laughter where her grace


princess

thy news boyet


boyet

prepare madam prepare
arm wenches arm encounters mounted are
against your peace love doth approach disguised
armed in arguments youll be surprised
muster your wits stand in your own defence
or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence


princess

saint denis to saint cupid what are they
that charge their breath against us say scout say


boyet

under the cool shade of a sycamore
i thought to close mine eyes some half an hour
when lo to interrupt my purposed rest
toward that shade i might behold addrest
the king and his companions warily
i stole into a neighbour thicket by
and overheard what you shall overhear
that by and by disguised they will be here
their herald is a pretty knavish page
that well by heart hath conn his embassage
action and accent did they teach him there
thus must thou speak and thus thy body bear
and ever and anon they made a doubt
presence majestical would put him out
for quoth the king an angel shalt thou see
yet fear not thou but speak audaciously
the boy replied an angel is not evil
i should have fear her had she been a devil
with that all laugh and clapp him on the shoulder
making the bold wag by their praises bolder
one rubb his elbow thus and fleer and swore
a better speech was never spoke before
another with his finger and his thumb
cried via we will dot come what will come
the third he caper and cried all goes well
the fourth turn on the toe and down he fell
with that they all did tumble on the ground
with such a zealous laughter so profound
that in this spleen ridiculous appears
to cheque their folly passion solemn tears


princess

but what but what come they to visit us


boyet

they do they do and are apparell thus
like muscovites or russians as i guess
their purpose is to parle to court and dance
and every one his love-feat will advance
unto his several mistress which theyll know
by favours several which they did bestow


princess

and will they so the gallants shall be task
for ladies we shall every one be mask
and not a man of them shall have the grace
despite of suit to see a lady face
hold rosaline this favour thou shalt wear
and then the king will court thee for his dear
hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine
so shall biron take me for rosaline
and change your favours too so shall your loves
woo contrary deceived by these removes


rosaline

come on then wear the favours most in sight


katharine

but in this changing what is your intent


princess

the effect of my intent is to cross theirs
they do it but in mocking merriment
and mock for mock is only my intent
their several counsels they unbosom shall
to loves mistook and so be mock withal
upon the next occasion that we meet
with visages displayed to talk and greet


rosaline

but shall we dance if they desire tot


princess

no to the death we will not move a foot
nor to their penn speech render we no grace
but while tis spoke each turn away her face


boyet

why that contempt will kill the speaker heart
and quite divorce his memory from his part


princess

therefore i do it and i make no doubt
the rest will neer come in if he be out
there no such sport as sport by sport oerthrown
to make theirs ours and ours none but our own
so shall we stay mocking intended game
and they well mock depart away with shame
trumpets sound within


boyet

the trumpet sounds be mask the maskers come
the ladies mask
enter blackamoors with music moth ferdinand  biron longaville and dumain in russian habits and masked


moth

all hail the richest beauties on the earth 


boyet

beauties no richer than rich taffeta


moth

a holy parcel of the fairest dames
the ladies turn their backs to him
that ever turn their backs to mortal views


biron

aside to moth  their eyes villain their eyes


moth

that ever turn their eyes to mortal views out 


boyet

true out indeed


moth

out of your favours heavenly spirits vouchsafe
not to behold 


biron

aside to moth  once to behold rogue


moth

once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes
 with your sun-beamed eyes 


boyet

they will not answer to that epithet
you were best call it aughter-beamed eyes


moth

they do not mark me and that brings me out


biron

is this your perfectness be gone you rogue
exit moth


rosaline

what would these strangers know their minds boyet
if they do speak our language tis our will
that some plain man recount their purposes
know what they would


boyet

what would you with the princess


biron

nothing but peace and gentle visitation


rosaline

what would they say they


boyet

nothing but peace and gentle visitation


rosaline

why that they have and bid them so be gone


boyet

she says you have it and you may be gone


ferdinand

say to her we have measured many miles
to tread a measure with her on this grass


boyet

they say that they have measured many a mile
to tread a measure with you on this grass


rosaline

it is not so ask them how many inches
is in one mile if they have measured many
the measure then of one is easily told


boyet

if to come hither you have measured miles
and many miles the princess bids you tell
how many inches doth fill up one mile


biron

tell her we measure them by weary steps


boyet

she hears herself


rosaline

how many weary steps
of many weary miles you have oergone
are number in the travel of one mile


biron

we number nothing that we spend for you
our duty is so rich so infinite
that we may do it still without accompt
vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face
that we like savages may worship it


rosaline

my face is but a moon and clouded too


ferdinand

blessed are clouds to do as such clouds do
vouchsafe bright moon and these thy stars to shine
those clouds removed upon our watery eyne


rosaline

o vain petitioner beg a greater matter
thou now request but moonshine in the water


ferdinand

then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change
thou bid me beg this begging is not strange


rosaline

play music then nay you must do it soon
music plays
not yet no dance thus change i like the moon


ferdinand

will you not dance how come you thus estranged


rosaline

you took the moon at full but now she changed


ferdinand

yet still she is the moon and i the man
the music plays vouchsafe some motion to it


rosaline

our ears vouchsafe it


ferdinand

but your legs should do it


rosaline

since you are strangers and come here by chance
well not be nice take hands we will not dance


ferdinand

why take we hands then


rosaline

only to part friends
curtsy sweet hearts and so the measure ends


ferdinand

more measure of this measure be not nice


rosaline

we can afford no more at such a price


ferdinand

prize you yourselves what buys your company


rosaline

your absence only


ferdinand

that can never be


rosaline

then cannot we be bought and so adieu
twice to your visor and half once to you


ferdinand

if you deny to dance let hold more chat


rosaline

in private then


ferdinand

i am best pleased with that
they converse apart


biron

white-handed mistress one sweet word with thee


princess

honey and milk and sugar there is three


biron

and would afford my speechless vizard half


katharine

longaville

katharine

longaville

katharine

longaville

will you give horns chaste lady do not so


katharine

then die a calf before your horns do grow


longaville

one word in private with you ere i die


katharine

bleat softly then the butcher hears you cry
they converse apart


boyet

the tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
as is the razor edge invisible
cutting a smaller hair than may be seen
above the sense of sense so sensible
seemeth their conference their conceits have wings
fleeter than arrows bullets wind thought swifter things


rosaline

not one word more my maids break off break off


biron

by heaven all dry-beaten with pure scoff


ferdinand

farewell mad wenches you have simple wits


princess

twenty adieus my frozen muscovits
exeunt ferdinand lords and blackamoors
are these the breed of wits so wonder at


boyet

tapers they are with your sweet breaths puff out


rosaline

well-liking wits they have gross gross fat fat


princess

o poverty in wit kingly-poor flout
will they not think you hang themselves tonight
or ever but in vizards show their faces
this pert biron was out of countenance quite


rosaline

o they were all in lamentable cases
the king was weeping-ripe for a good word


princess

biron did swear himself out of all suit


maria

dumain was at my service and his sword
no point quoth i my servant straight was mute


katharine

lord longaville said i came oer his heart
and trow you what he called me


princess

qualm perhaps


katharine

yes in good faith


princess

go sickness as thou art


rosaline

well better wits have worn plain statute-caps
but will you hear the king is my love sworn


princess

and quick biron hath plighted faith to me


katharine

and longaville was for my service born


maria

dumain is mine as sure as bark on tree


boyet

madam and pretty mistresses give ear
immediately they will again be here
in their own shapes for it can never be
they will digest this harsh indignity


princess

will they return


boyet

they will they will god knows
and leap for joy though they are lame with blows
therefore change favours and when they repair
blow like sweet roses in this summer air


princess

how blow how blow speak to be understood


boyet

fair ladies mask are roses in their bud
dismask their damask sweet commixture shown
are angels vailing clouds or roses blown


princess

avaunt perplexity what shall we do
if they return in their own shapes to woo


rosaline

good madam if by me youll be advised
let mock them still as well known as disguised
let us complain to them what fools were here
disguised like muscovites in shapeless gear
and wonder what they were and to what end
their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn
and their rough carriage so ridiculous
should be presented at our tent to us


boyet

ladies withdraw the gallants are at hand


princess

whip to our tents as roes run oer land
exeunt princess rosaline katharine and maria
re-enter ferdinand biron longaville and dumain in their proper habits


ferdinand

fair sir god save you where the princess


boyet

gone to her tent please it your majesty
command me any service to her thither


ferdinand

that she vouchsafe me audience for one word


boyet

i will and so will she i know my lord
exit


biron

this fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease
and utters it again when god doth please
he is wit pedler and retails his wares
at wakes and wassails meetings markets fairs
and we that sell by gross the lord doth know
have not the grace to grace it with such show
this gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve
had he been adam he had tempted eve
a can carve too and lisp why this is he
that kiss his hand away in courtesy
this is the ape of form monsieur the nice
that when he plays at tables chides the dice
in honourable terms nay he can sing
a mean most meanly and in ushering
mend him who can the ladies call him sweet
the stairs as he treads on them kiss his feet
this is the flower that smiles on every one
to show his teeth as white as whale bone
and consciences that will not die in debt
pay him the due of honey-tongued boyet


ferdinand

a blister on his sweet tongue with my heart
that put armado page out of his part


biron

see where it comes behavior what wert thou
till this madman show thee and what art thou now
re-enter the princess ushered by boyet rosaline maria and katharine


ferdinand

all hail sweet madam and fair time of day


princess

fair in all hail is foul as i conceive


ferdinand

construe my speeches better if you may


princess

then wish me better i will give you leave


ferdinand

we came to visit you and purpose now
to lead you to our court vouchsafe it then


princess

this field shall hold me and so hold your vow
nor god nor i delights in perjured men


ferdinand

rebuke me not for that which you provoke
the virtue of your eye must break my oath


princess

you nickname virtue vice you should have spoke
for virtue office never breaks men troth
now by my maiden honour yet as pure
as the unsullied lily i protest
a world of torments though i should endure
i would not yield to be your house guest
so much i hate a breaking cause to be
of heavenly oaths vow with integrity


ferdinand

o you have lived in desolation here
unseen unvisited much to our shame


princess

not so my lord it is not so i swear
we have had pastimes here and pleasant game
a mess of russians left us but of late


ferdinand

how madam russians


princess

ay in truth my lord
trim gallants full of courtship and of state


rosaline

madam speak true it is not so my lord
my lady to the manner of the days
in courtesy gives undeserving praise
we four indeed confronted were with four
in russian habit here they stay an hour
and talk apace and in that hour my lord
they did not bless us with one happy word
i dare not call them fools but this i think
when they are thirsty fools would fain have drink


biron

this jest is dry to me fair gentle sweet
your wit makes wise things foolish when we greet
with eyes best seeing heaven fiery eye
by light we lose light your capacity
is of that nature that to your huge store
wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor


rosaline

this proves you wise and rich for in my eye 


biron

i am a fool and full of poverty


rosaline

but that you take what doth to you belong
it were a fault to snatch words from my tongue


biron

o i am yours and all that i possess


rosaline

all the fool mine


biron

i cannot give you less


rosaline

which of the vizards was it that you wore


biron

where when what vizard why demand you this


rosaline

there then that vizard that superfluous case
that hid the worse and show the better face


ferdinand

we are descried theyll mock us now downright


dumain

let us confess and turn it to a jest


princess

amazed my lord why looks your highness sad


rosaline

help hold his brows hell swoon why look you pale
sea-sick i think coming from muscovy


biron

thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury
can any face of brass hold longer out


here stand i

lady dart thy skill at me
bruise me with scorn confound me with a flout
thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance
cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit
and i will wish thee never more to dance
nor never more in russian habit wait
o never will i trust to speeches penn
nor to the motion of a schoolboy tongue
nor never come in vizard to my friend
nor woo in rhyme like a blind harper song
taffeta phrases silken terms precise
three-piled hyperboles spruce affectation
figures pedantical these summer-flies
have blown me full of maggot ostentation
i do forswear them and i here protest
by this white glove how white the hand god knows 
henceforth my wooing mind shall be express
in russet yeas and honest kersey noes
and to begin wench so god help me la 
my love to thee is sound sans crack or flaw


rosaline

sans sans i pray you


biron

yet i have a trick
of the old rage bear with me i am sick
ill leave it by degrees soft let us see
write lord have mercy on us on those three
they are infected in their hearts it lies
they have the plague and caught it of your eyes
these lords are visited you are not free
for the lord tokens on you do i see


princess

no they are free that gave these tokens to us


biron

our states are forfeit seek not to undo us


rosaline

it is not so for how can this be true
that you stand forfeit being those that sue


biron

peace for i will not have to do with you


rosaline

nor shall not if i do as i intend


biron

speak for yourselves my wit is at an end


ferdinand

teach us sweet madam for our rude transgression
some fair excuse


princess

the fairest is confession
were not you here but even now disguised


ferdinand

madam i was


princess

and were you well advised


ferdinand

i was fair madam


princess

when you then were here
what did you whisper in your lady ear


ferdinand

that more than all the world i did respect her


princess

when she shall challenge this you will reject her


ferdinand

upon mine honour no


princess

peace peace forbear
your oath once broke you force not to forswear


ferdinand

despise me when i break this oath of mine


princess

i will and therefore keep it rosaline
what did the russian whisper in your ear


rosaline

madam he swore that he did hold me dear
as precious eyesight and did value me
above this world adding thereto moreover
that he would wed me or else die my lover


princess

god give thee joy of him the noble lord
most honourably doth unhold his word


ferdinand

what mean you madam by my life my troth
i never swore this lady such an oath


rosaline

by heaven you did and to confirm it plain
you gave me this but take it sir again


ferdinand

my faith and this the princess i did give
i knew her by this jewel on her sleeve


princess

pardon me sir this jewel did she wear
and lord biron i thank him is my dear
what will you have me or your pearl again


biron

neither of either i remit both twain
i see the trick ont here was a consent
knowing aforehand of our merriment
to dash it like a christmas comedy
some carry-tale some please-man some slight zany
some mumble-news some trencher-knight some dick
that smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
to make my lady laugh when she disposed
told our intents before which once disclosed
the ladies did change favours and then we
following the signs woo but the sign of she
now to our perjury to add more terror
we are again forsworn in will and error
much upon this it is and might not you
to boyet
forestall our sport to make us thus untrue
do not you know my lady foot by the squier
and laugh upon the apple of her eye
and stand between her back sir and the fire
holding a trencher jesting merrily
you put our page out go you are allow
die when you will a smock shall be your shroud
you leer upon me do you there an eye
wounds like a leaden sword


boyet

ferdinand

how fares your majesty


princess

boyet prepare i will away tonight


ferdinand

madam not so i do beseech you stay


princess

prepare i say i thank you gracious lords
for all your fair endeavors and entreat
out of a new-sad soul that you vouchsafe
in your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
the liberal opposition of our spirits
if over-boldly we have borne ourselves
in the converse of breath your gentleness
was guilty of it farewell worthy lord
a heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue
excuse me so coming too short of thanks
for my great suit so easily obtain


ferdinand

the extreme parts of time extremely forms
all causes to the purpose of his speed
and often at his very loose decides
that which long process could not arbitrate
and though the mourning brow of progeny
forbid the smiling courtesy of love
the holy suit which fain it would convince
yet since love argument was first on foot
let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
from what it purposed since to wail friends lost
is not by much so wholesome-profitable
as to rejoice at friends but newly found


princess

i understand you not my griefs are double


biron

honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief
and by these badges understand the king
for your fair sakes have we neglected time
play foul play with our oaths your beauty ladies
hath much deform us fashioning our humours
even to the opposed end of our intents
and what in us hath seem ridiculous 
as love is full of unbefitting strains
all wanton as a child skipping and vain
form by the eye and therefore like the eye
full of strange shapes of habits and of forms
varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
to every varied object in his glance
which parti-coated presence of loose love
put on by us if in your heavenly eyes
have misbecomed our oaths and gravities
those heavenly eyes that look into these faults
suggested us to make therefore ladies
our love being yours the error that love makes
is likewise yours we to ourselves prove false
by being once false for ever to be true
to those that make us both fair ladies you
and even that falsehood in itself a sin
thus purifies itself and turns to grace


princess

we have received your letters full of love
your favours the ambassadors of love
and in our maiden council rated them
at courtship pleasant jest and courtesy
as bombast and as lining to the time
but more devout than this in our respects
have we not been and therefore met your loves
in their own fashion like a merriment


dumain

our letters madam show much more than jest


longaville

so did our looks


rosaline

we did not quote them so


ferdinand

now at the latest minute of the hour
grant us your loves


princess

a time methinks too short
to make a world-without-end bargain in
no no my lord your grace is perjured much
full of dear guiltiness and therefore this
if for my love as there is no such cause
you will do aught this shall you do for me
your oath i will not trust but go with speed
to some forlorn and naked hermitage
remote from all the pleasures of the world
there stay until the twelve celestial signs
have brought about the annual reckoning
if this austere insociable life
change not your offer made in heat of blood
if frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds
nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love
but that it bear this trial and last love
then at the expiration of the year
come challenge me challenge me by these deserts
and by this virgin palm now kissing thine
i will be thine and till that instant shut
my woeful self up in a mourning house
raining the tears of lamentation
for the remembrance of my father death
if this thou do deny let our hands part
neither entitled in the other heart


ferdinand

if this or more than this i would deny
to flatter up these powers of mine with rest
the sudden hand of death close up mine eye
hence ever then my heart is in thy breast


dumain

but what to me my love but what to me a wife


katharine

a beard fair health and honesty
with three-fold love i wish you all these three


dumain

o shall i say i thank you gentle wife


katharine

not so my lord a twelvemonth and a day
ill mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say
come when the king doth to my lady come
then if i have much love ill give you some


dumain

ill serve thee true and faithfully till then


katharine

yet swear not lest ye be forsworn again


longaville

what says maria


maria

at the twelvemonth end
ill change my black gown for a faithful friend


longaville

ill stay with patience but the time is long


maria

the liker you few taller are so young


biron

studies my lady mistress look on me
behold the window of my heart mine eye
what humble suit attends thy answer there
impose some service on me for thy love


rosaline

oft have i heard of you my lord biron
before i saw you and the world large tongue
proclaims you for a man replete with mocks
full of comparisons and wounding flouts
which you on all estates will execute
that lie within the mercy of your wit
to weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain
and therewithal to win me if you please
without the which i am not to be won
you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
visit the speechless sick and still converse
with groaning wretches and your task shall be
with all the fierce endeavor of your wit
to enforce the pained impotent to smile


biron

to move wild laughter in the throat of death
it cannot be it is impossible
mirth cannot move a soul in agony


rosaline

why that the way to choke a gibing spirit
whose influence is begot of that loose grace
which shallow laughing hearers give to fools
a jest prosperity lies in the ear
of him that hears it never in the tongue
of him that makes it then if sickly ears
deaf with the clamours of their own dear groans
will hear your idle scorns continue then
and i will have you and that fault withal
but if they will not throw away that spirit
and i shall find you empty of that fault
right joyful of your reformation


biron

a twelvemonth well befall what will befall
ill jest a twelvemonth in an hospital


princess

to ferdinand  ay sweet my lord and so i take my leave


ferdinand

no madam we will bring you on your way


biron

our wooing doth not end like an old play
jack hath not jill these ladies courtesy
might well have made our sport a comedy

and then twill end

but how of cawdor the thane of cawdor lives
a prosperous gentleman and to be king
stands not within the prospect of belief
no more than to be cawdor say from whence
you owe this strange intelligence or why
upon this blasted heath you stop our way
with such prophetic greeting speak i charge you
witches vanish


banquo

the earth hath bubbles as the water has
and these are of them whither are they vanish


macbeth

into the air and what seem corporal melted
as breath into the wind would they had stay


banquo

were such things here as we do speak about
or have we eaten on the insane root
that takes the reason prisoner


macbeth

your children shall be kings


banquo

you shall be king


macbeth

and thane of cawdor too went it not so


banquo

to the selfsame tune and words who here
enter ross and angus


ross

the king hath happily received macbeth
the news of thy success and when he reads
thy personal venture in the rebels fight
his wonders and his praises do contend
which should be thine or his silenced with that
in viewing oer the rest o the selfsame day
he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks
nothing afeard of what thyself didst make
strange images of death as thick as hail
came post with post and every one did bear
thy praises in his kingdom great defence
and pour them down before him


angus

we are sent
to give thee from our royal master thanks
only to herald thee into his sight
not pay thee


ross

and for an earnest of a greater honour
he bade me from him call thee thane of cawdor
in which addition hail most worthy thane
for it is thine


banquo

what can the devil speak true


macbeth

the thane of cawdor lives why do you dress me
in borrow robes


angus

who was the thane lives yet
but under heavy judgment bears that life
which he deserves to lose whether he was combined
with those of norway or did line the rebel
with hidden help and vantage or that with both
he labour in his country wreck i know not
but treasons capital confess and proved
have overthrown him


macbeth

aside  glamis and thane of cawdor
the greatest is behind
to ross and angus
thanks for your pains
to banquo
do you not hope your children shall be kings
when those that gave the thane of cawdor to me
promised no less to them


banquo

that trusted home
might yet enkindle you unto the crown
besides the thane of cawdor but tis strange
and oftentimes to win us to our harm
the instruments of darkness tell us truths
win us with honest trifles to betray
in deepest consequence
cousins a word i pray you


macbeth

asidetwo truths are told
as happy prologues to the swelling act
of the imperial theme i thank you gentlemen
aside
cannot be ill cannot be good if ill
why hath it given me earnest of success
commencing in a truth i am thane of cawdor
if good why do i yield to that suggestion
whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
and make my seated heart knock at my ribs
against the use of nature present fears
are less than horrible imaginings
my thought whose murder yet is but fantastical
shakes so my single state of man that function
is smother in surmise and nothing is
but what is not


banquo

look how our partner rapt


macbeth

aside  if chance will have me king why chance may crown me
without my stir


banquo

new horrors come upon him
like our strange garments cleave not to their mould
but with the aid of use


macbeth

aside                come what come may
time and the hour runs through the roughest day


banquo

worthy macbeth we stay upon your leisure


macbeth

give me your favour my dull brain was wrought
with things forgotten kind gentlemen your pains
are register where every day i turn
the leaf to read them let us toward the king
think upon what hath chanced and at more time
the interim having weigh it let us speak
our free hearts each to other


banquo

very gladly


macbeth

till then enough come friends

malcolm

my liege
they are not yet come back but i have spoke
with one that saw him die who did report
that very frankly he confess his treasons
implored your highness pardon and set forth
a deep repentance nothing in his life
became him like the leaving it he died
as one that had been studied in his death
to throw away the dearest thing he owed
as twere a careless trifle

to find the mind construction in the face
he was a gentleman on whom i built
an absolute trust
enter macbeth banquo ross and angus
o worthiest cousin
the sin of my ingratitude even now
was heavy on me thou art so far before
that swiftest wing of recompense is slow
to overtake thee would thou hadst less deserved
that the proportion both of thanks and payment
might have been mine only i have left to say
more is thy due than more than all can pay


macbeth

the service and the loyalty i owe
in doing it pays itself your highness part
is to receive our duties and our duties
are to your throne and state children and servants
which do but what they should by doing every thing
safe toward your love and honour


duncan

to make thee full of growing noble banquo
that hast no less deserved nor must be known
no less to have done so let me enfold thee
and hold thee to my heart


banquo

there if i grow
the harvest is your own


duncan

my plenteous joys
wanton in fulness seek to hide themselves
in drops of sorrow sons kinsmen thanes
and you whose places are the nearest know
we will establish our estate upon
our eldest malcolm whom we name hereafter
the prince of cumberland which honour must
not unaccompanied invest him only
but signs of nobleness like stars shall shine
on all deservers from hence to inverness
and bind us further to you


macbeth

the rest is labour which is not used for you
ill be myself the harbinger and make joyful
the hearing of my wife with your approach
so humbly take my leave
